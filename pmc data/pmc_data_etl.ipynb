      "Plasmapheresis for Spur Cell Anemia in a Patient with Alcoholic Liver Cirrhosis\n",
      "a 52-year-old japanese man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and a history of previous esophageal varices and hepatic encephalopathy was referred to our hospital. at admission, he was afebrile, icteric, and anemic and complained of abdominal pain due to accumulated ascites. he had none of the neurological symptoms of neuroacanthocytosis []. he was alert, with a blood pressure of 126/66 mmhg, a heart rate of 108/min, a respiratory rate of 20/min, and an spo2 of 95% (room air). laboratory data are shown in . he was found to have pleural fluid, ascites associated with liver cirrhosis (child–pugh c with 12 points) and hypoalbuminemia, and chronic kidney dysfunction. his indirect bilirubin concentration and reticulocyte counts were increased, and his haptoglobin concentration was decreased, while his vitamin b12 and folate levels were normal. a blood smear showed spur cells rather than fragmented red cells (, ). assessments of serum lipid concentrations showed markedly reduced triglyceride, hdl cholesterol, ldl cholesterol, lipoprotein (a), phospholipid, apo-ai, and apo-aii concentrations (). mild splenomegaly was noted. he was slightly diabetic with high serum glycoalbumin (21.5%; reference 11.6–16.4%) and showed coagulopathy, including thrombocytopenia, prolonged aptt, and hypofibrinogenemia, as well as reduced at-iii. assessments of coagulation factors showed that factor ii, v, vii, and ix activities were all reduced, while factor viii was not. adamts13 activity was within the normal range (). blood smear preparations after incubating the patient's serum with control rbcs of the same blood type for 24 hours clearly showed formation of spur cells, indicating that this patient's dyslipidemia was responsible for spiculated control rbcs (data not shown). the patient was diagnosed with sca.\n",
      "he had been drinking prior to his admission; however, during his stay in the hospital for 4 weeks, he was in a state of complete abstinence. after admission, he was first treated with ascites drainage, rbc transfusions, occasional albumin, and ffp infusions. thereafter, two courses of plasmapheresis (2,400 ml/course) were performed over 3 weeks' duration.\n",
      "the patient's reticulocyte counts decreased from 22.4% before to 4.5% after plasmapheresis. he also experienced increases in concentrations of total cholesterol, from 121 mg/dl to 214 mg/dl; phospholipids, from 112 mg/dl to 197 mg/dl; and apo-ai, from 48 mg/dl to 89 mg/dl. however, his lipoprotein (a), ldl cholesterol, and apo-aii concentrations, all of which were low before plasmapheresis, remained unchanged after, and his serum concentrations of indirect bilirubin and ldh did not improve significantly (). plasma fibrinogen concentrations improved rapidly after each course of plasmapheresis, but gradually declined to subnormal levels. the percentage of spur cells was unchanged or increased slightly. the patient's general condition gradually improved with the disappearance of pleural fluid and ascites, and hb concentration >8.0 g/dl without rbc transfusions. he was subsequently able to be discharged.\n",

      "a 30-year-old male, with no significant past medical history, came to the emergency department with complaints of fever and chills for a duration of 3 days. he also complained of myalgia and abdominal pain for the same duration. he reported diffuse abdominal pain, which was 6/10 in severity, nonradiating, and not related to food. he also reported 2 episodes of diarrhea without any blood or mucous, brown in color. he denied cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, weight loss, history of trauma, extreme exercise, or any history of travel.\n",
      "his abdominal examination was significant for abdominal tenderness in all four quadrants, but was soft and nondistended and bowel sounds were present. the rest of his examination was unremarkable. triage vitals were significant for a temperature of 103.3°f, heart rate of 88 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 109/49, and pulse oximetry of 99% on room air.\n",
      "admission laboratory workup revealed leukocyte count of 6.1 × 103 µl (reference range 4.5–11.0 × 103) with 72% neutrophils, hemoglobin of 16.2 g/dl (reference range 13.0–17.0), hematocrit of 48.2% (reference range 39–53), platelet count of 149 × 103 µl (reference range 130–400 × 103), esr of 4 mm/hr (reference range 0–20), bun of 34 mg/dl (reference range 8–20), creatinine of 1.8 mg/dl (reference range 0.4–1.3), potassium of 4.7 mmol/l (reference range 3.6–5.1), phosphorous of 3.0 mg/dl (reference range 2.4–4.7), aspartate aminotransferase of 1,146 iu/l (reference range 15–41), alanine aminotransferase of 243 iu/l (reference range 17–63), and creatinine kinase of 39,125 iu/l (reference range 38–398). urinalysis was significant for large blood, and urine red blood cells were 0–2.\n",
      "in view of the high-grade fever, we attempted to find an infectious source to explain his history and presentation. chest x-ray () and ct scan were obtained and showed no signs of pneumonia. urinalysis and influenza rapid antigen test were performed and did not reveal any abnormalities. ct of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained and did not reveal any focal sources. stool culture with ova and parasites, blood cultures, urinary toxicology including synthetic thc (k2), hiv, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis panel, mycoplasma pneumoniae igm antibody, urine legionella antigen, quantiferon® test for tuberculosis, and tsh were all performed as well. all the test results were negative except immunoglobulin m antibodies for mycoplasma pneumoniae that were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the antibodies were initially 781 u/ml, which is considered a low positive (reference range 770–950).\n",
      "our patient was empirically started on levofloxacin and metronidazole for possible gastroenteritis initially while culture and laboratory results were pending. he was managed for his acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis with aggressive parenteral hydration. however, he continued to spike fevers during days 1–4 of the admission, but his diarrhea, abdominal pain, and myalgia resolved by day 3. one week later, mycoplasma antibody was recorded again and it was 976 u/ml, which is considered a true positive (reference range 950+). the fact that the antibody titer was trending up was clinically significant for a recent mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. after mycoplasma was found to be positive, metronidazole was discontinued and he was continued with levofloxacin. his creatinine, liver function tests, and ck trended down to normal reference ranges (), and he was discharged on day 9 with planned outpatient follow-up.\n",
