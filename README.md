# Synthetic Data Generation Framework for Privacy-Preserving Production Data Enhancing LLM Performance

## Project Overview


In todayâ€™s data-driven landscape, organizations increasingly rely on large language models (LLMs) for a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing, customer service automation, and data analysis. However, the use of real-world data for training these models presents significant privacy concerns, especially when sensitive information is involved. Traditional data anonymization techniques often lead to substantial information loss, which compromises the utility of the data.
To address this challenge, we propose developing a synthetic data generation framework that ensures privacy preservation while maintaining the statistical properties of original datasets. This framework will enable organizations to train LLMs effectively without exposing sensitive information, enhancing both data security and model performance.
