Thought it may have been over kill for a business trip. I was wrong. On a full charge, both phone and pack, I had power all day and didn't put it back on my charger till morning, but I bet I probably could have stretched it out till noon before my phone would have died.<br />Beyond glad I kept it.<br />I did drop my phone a few times and the battery popped off but there was no real damage and it just popped back on without issue and kept working.<br /><br />One con. Dont get it to close to your laptop. Not sure how, must me the magnet inside the pack, but it puts my computer into hibernate mode. Took me a few times to figure that the pack was doing it to my computer when I rested near my mouse pad.<br /><br />Still love it.\\n\\n### Rating:\\n5 <|end_of_text|>\"}"

It was a little little on the loose fitting side but now it's fine. I've dropped my phone quite a bit and my phone has come out fine. I have a tempered glass screen protector on it and I'm pretty sure that's what saved my phone. I don't think this case would have protected it. I'm not sure how well it would have protected the camera on the back of the phone. It is a little bit loose and I've had it come off a few times. I haven't had it fall off yet though.

There is a small metal pin that the clip hinges on, and it came out. I managed to put it back together, and get the spring in place. It is working, but I have to keep an eye on the pin. Honestly, if I just didn't like the case, and the way it holds the phone on the belt clip, I would be inclined to give a totally negative review. I'm just hoping to get as much time out of this case as possible. It's hard to find a case of any quality for the LG stylo 2.

No complaints from my Kindle.<br /><br />You can see from other reviews that it has a nice built-in nightlight. I figure that feature as eye-candy. It's main selling point in my opinion is the 4.8 amp total output producing 2.4 amps per plug. Another nice feature is that 110 v. plug hides away when you have it packed for traveling.\n",

So I had to contact customer support, they sent a new one, which I received the day before my trip abroad. I was in a panic, because there were no delivery options besides First Class USPS, all the way across the country from Niagra Falls to California. Installation of the sticker was easy, but getting the app to work was not. I Traveled from San Francisco to Vancouver, BC, had a 24 hour layover, and could not get the app to work. I only had WiFi at my AirB&B, other navigation was impossible, forgot an essential medication that required all my waking time to acquire in a different country. So, I had to wait until I landed in London, accomplished transit travel without navigation again, and settled once again in my AirB&B, to get WiFi, so that I could contact tech support over and over again, to get set up to use. I was so grateful to have navigation again, no time to go further with setup, before I was off to my next destination. Every time one changes county, region, country, one must go back to settings, ask what SIM am I on, reboot the phone, wait for connection, sometimes taking extraordinary amounts of time to do this several times. I could not make phone calls, as I did not want to use the ReachMe services to get political and telemarketing calls and texts while abroad, nor any nonessential calls and texts. WiFi on the trains was virtually impossible without purchasing lengthy times, and most times the data was reading NoService. The last long train trip I made, was an exercise in \"seconds count\", as I had attempted to contact a friend in Slovenia by emails, every means possible, until I was successful in setting up WhatsApp after much travail. We were able to communicate with seconds to spare to meet at the correct location. Once back home, I could not make or receive phone calls or texts for days, then the recommendation was to set my network statistics, which meant I ditched ALL my accounts and passwords saved in this phone. Uh, NO!<br />The support team at KnowRoaming was wonderful, replying quickly to my panic emails.<br />The cost? I have not added up as yet what I spent on data packages, but it was worth the peace of mind knowing that I could access, most of the time.<br />Many trials and tribulations with this sticker, I loved having access when I had it, but I think next time I go abroad, I would purchase the substitute SIM card, replace with my carrier's SIM when I return home, and be relatively assured that I would not have so much hassle with the sticker.\n",

            "Review: I have only had this abut a week, but I was pleased to find I could put my iPhone SE into it without removing it from its Otter Box Defender case.  The belt/sleeve holds the phone snuggly against my bicep, and if I put the phone in upside down, I can easily plug in the earphones or battery while it is riding in the sleeve.  Two things to be aware of; first this is a relatively tight sleeve.  It fits me perfectly but without much room to spare.  I am a medium sized woman without remarkable biceps, and many people (men especially) might find this too tight.  Second, I have found that the touch screen on the phone is not usable through the cover of this holder, on top of the defender cover. This is not a major problem for me as I as using it for working out and just set the phone up just as I want it before it goes in the sleeve, and I can answer phone calls if they come in on the earbud microphone.  So I just plan on not using the touch screen through these layers, but if you wanted to be able to do that you might feel disappointed.  Still, it has worked for me and I even got caught in a heavy rain and the phone stayed safe and dry. I am satisfied and have recommended it to others.\n",

            "Review: **updated review**<br /><br />After several hours of having the case charge it was finally fully charged. I popped my phone in turned it on and tell me why the case went from fully charged to just having 3 LED lights of charging..... MERP. I plugged the case back in with the phone attached and the case just went crazy with vibrating and not being able to charge the case while charging the phone. Idk if it’s a glitch or what, I mean it charges my phone but the other thing I don’t like is that the lights don’t stay on while using. I definitely have mixed feelings about this case...<br /><br />This review is strictly based off first impressions. I have not used it just yet, it’s in its 5 hour pre use charge still. Which it’s been charging for 3 hours so far and it still only has 3 solid LED lights the rest are still blinking.<br /><br />So first I’d like to start off that I love the feel of it. This is my second external battery case but from another company. I could do without the advertising on the back of the case but whatevs, as long as it does it’s job.<br /><br />I do want to point out that the case is a completely DIFFERENT design than it shows on the front of the box. The case is really thick around the camera area of the phone and I hope it doesn’t cast a shadow on my pics when I use the flash.<br /><br />On the back where the instructions are you can tell it’s talking about a different model because no where on this case does anything close or attach to anything. The whole case is just one piece which is fine with me, that’s how my last case was but the top was flexible to slide the phone in. Which takes me to my next point.. the directions clearlu state DO NOT CREATE AN ANGLE while taking phone in or out of case......... how can I not create an angle my phone just won’t pop in the case, it can’t.. it has the connector in the way.<br /><br />AGAIN this is just off first impressions, I still have high hopes for this but I just wish the case was what I thought I was purchasing.\n",

It also came with a screen protector kit and a stylus pen. I didn't know it came with the pen when I purchased it so that was a nice bonus! My phone already has a screen protector so I didn't use the one that came with the case. It's just a standard plastic protector, nothing fancy. Use it or not.

I've had other covers that require regular removal a cleaning but this one keeps the dirt out. It provides excellent protection, is not too bulky, fits in most pouches and looks stylish.<br />I only have one issue otherwise it would get 5 stars. It comes with a built in clear plastic screen protection which is required in order to provide a good environmental seal. The problem is that the clear plastic screen protection does not fit well, looks ugly and is not great to use. I am not too concerned about the environmental seal so in frustration ripped out the clear plastic. It requires quite a bit of force to do this (start in a corner with a blunt object) but eventually parts cleanly on the glue that is used to attach it and does not affect the look of the product at all. The residual glue inside the cover actually provides quite a good seal against the screen. I then installed the Tech Armor Balistic glass which fits perfectly with this cover.<br />If I was designing this product, I would remove the clear plastic screen cover or make it a removable option and add a silicone seal where it touches the screen so that it could seal onto a Balistic glass.\n",

In use, it needed firm, steady pressure to retain contact. or you had to start over with a continuous line.<br />11/27/22 Ok. it does shut off automatically.

The phone worked well with his AT&T sim card and calls were clear. There was no problem with signal and call quality that is not normal for AT&T in this area.<br />The only problem with the phone was that it was hard for him to learn how to use it. With the lack of a real display and only a small window for text he had a hard time figuring out how to make calls. It took me a few minutes to figure the phone out and get numbers programmed into it for him also.  The interface is not very intuitive, even for me and I have degrees in IT.<br /><br />Overall the phone is excellent and works well.

            "Review: I have bought from LK before and they are a trusted brand, their stuff is durable and is sold at an affordable price, plus they come with a warranty.<br /><br />This product is a good case for an Apple Watch. It came well packaged and ready to use. The only thing is that it did not have an instruction sheet on how to put the case on, but there is a video detailing the process on their website and the Amazon page. The video might not be needed though, since it was a very easy and simple installation/putting it on the watch. Just clean it with the provided wipes and cloth, remove the dust, and the case is ready to go on. Pull the sticker off the case, line it up, start with the button side, and just snap it on.<br /><br />It protects the watch very well, each side and especially the screen. It does give some peace of mind having something to protect the watch screen since it is glass and could break if something were to hit it too hard. The sensitivity is good and it’s hard to tell a difference between using the watch screen with the case vs without the case.<br /><br />There are only 3 drawbacks with the product. One is that it makes it harder to hit the power button on the side. The plastic comes out and protects that area, but the button is recessed and lower than the surrounding plastic so it is not as convenient to click. Instead of just casually clicking the button as I would in the past I have to use my nail. This can be solved if the case is built like an iPhone case, where the power button usually has a rubber button extender on it making it easy to press. Hopefully future iterations will have that feature, but for now just know it takes some getting used to.<br /><br />One other drawback is a rainbow type dot/smudge appears between the watch and the protector. It moves around depending on how you press it, but it doesn’t go away.<br /><br />The third drawback is just being careful with it around water. I washed my hands with my watch on and some water got stuck between the watch and the case, and to get it out you have to take the case off and dry it, then put it on again.<br /><br />TLDR: This case is a great value for what you pay for it. It does a great job protecting it from physical damage and is as sensitive as the watch face is. It has a few flaws, but they are more slight inconveniences that do not detract from the safety of the watch. I would recommend getting this if you are looking for something to protect your watch from physical damage. Personally I prefer this over the film protectors, since the film protectors don't last long and are annoying to install.\n",

I DO wish that the top and bottom bumpers that extend above the S8+ screen extended even further.  But the case holds well in my hand and protects the phone well.<br /><br />A final comment is that I'd not thought about how the case would NOT work to hold a popsocket or pop stand.  The multi-dimentioned back leaves too limited a space to get a good glue grip for that item.  I really wish the case had a larger flat surface on the back to permit such usage.\n",

            "Review: I ordered this item because it was exactly what I was looking for.  Unfortunately, when I received it, I found out that the beautiful Champagne Gold outer case was made of plastic and the inner rubber case was very stiff.  This would not hold up to my wear and tear of my cell phone.  I needed a subtle rubber inner case for flexibilkity with a metal outer case for strong usage and protection since I use my cell phone all the time and it needs a case that would stand up to strong and constant handling.  If this item were made of durable, plyable rubber and metal instead of plastic, I would definitely recommend it.  Since it does not, I returned it.\n",

            "Review: I like the one-handed operation for inserting & removing my phone. It has a great self-actuating mechanism to close the grips around the phone's edges when it contacts that back wall of the mount. The clamps for the air vent are excellent & provide a very solid feel, significantly reducing the chance that it will fall off.<br /><br />The only delicate part of the installation is to get everything at just the right angles. You will likely need to use an iterative process to tighten & rotate the mount into position, as one can affect there other. No big deal, just needs a bit of patience & fiddling, likely less than for similar products. But worth the effort!\n",

            "Review: Note that this is a flexible film, not the typical tempered glass screen protector, for the Samsung S22 Ultra in my case. Tempered glass did not work for me as it left a virtual hole in my screen for the fingerprint reader.<br /><br />If you follow the instruction video fully, you should have no trouble. It is very critical that you have a dust-free environment. Having said that, I ended up with 2 small dust specs that were not worth the trouble to fix. In fact, I can't even see them when the screen is on.<br /><br />You really need to do this when you have an overnight window to let the film dry & cure. I was concerned with the texture & graininess after installation, including some very small air bubbles. Per the instructions, these fully disappeared by morning. There is also a warning about needing to redo your fingerprints, as the film may make your existing fingerprints ineffective. In my case, I did not need to do this at all, my old fingerprints worked just fine. Bonus!<br /><br />Touch sensitivity is great, with a less frictionless surface than the original phone & tempered glass screen protectors. This will give you a slightly different feel but it is not an issue once you get used to it.<br /><br />Overall, a great value when the tempered glass options from other vendors did not do it for me.\n",

            "Review: This is a sturdy case and holds the phone very well. Wireless charging was not compromised. The sliding cover for the rear cameras might seem clunky to some but it really protects the protruding cameras. The sliding cover moves in a slot to the right of the cameras but stays within the width of the phone/case, no protrusions. Now I can lay the phone down without worry.<br /><br />You will have to remember to slide the cover open and to close it, as these are not typical actions when using a phone camera. The \"use Night mode\" camera screen prompt is your reminder to slide the door over if not already done. Just need to remember to close it afterwards.<br /><br />Additionally, the full-width design eliminates the wobble when lying flat.<br /><br />The case should have more of a rubbery grip feel. Having said that, it is still very good and greatly beats the super slippery design of the phone. Lastly, the S-Pen recess will require a fingernail or small finger to release it. I was not able to release it with my thumb. I don't use the pen, so not an issue for me, might be for some. Overall, a great product, compensating for suboptimal phone design, at least in my opinion, better than any of the others I researched.\n",

            "Review: Received it today, due to an expanding battery problem. (You can look that up on the internet, so many reports of this issue).<br /><br />The provided tools made teardown really easy, but a word to the wise: Be careful to not slide any of the tools too far into the unit, only work the outside edges. I now have a pencil dot's worth of bad pixels, not too bad. The provided screwdriver is magnetic, making it really easy to pick up and place the screws for reinsertion. The spungers & plastic wedges were fine. The separation of my case back due to an expanded battery was so severe it made finding playing cards unnecessary, it was easy to gently peel off.<br /><br />I tried the phone without screwing things back to together to make sure it worked or putting the back on. It powered up fine out of the box, 50% charge, but I did have some network(s) connectivity issues. Putting the screws in and putting on the back worked, after apparently needing to do an extra reboot. The metal back may be proving antenna support/functionality. I did not see any instructions or links to instructions, the manufacturer may have a site for that. There are great videos on the internet that walk you through the entire process.\n",

I especially like the clip design, it holds the phone securely during the most energetic activity yet I have instant access to pull my phone up to remove the phone from the armband. That allows me to change my music, send a text, use an app, etc. then quickly slide the clip back into the holder on the armband without missing a beat. It is also extremely durable - the clip is strong and so far unbreakable, it is part of the case so there is no weak point at a connection. I've dropped it numerous times and the phone has never been damaged. The armband is a strong, yet somewhat stretchable neoprene - it last much longer than elastic, it's more comfortable, and it is amazingly &#34;stink&#34; resistant. All that and it is surprisingly less expensive than it's inferior competition.\n",

            "Review: I really dislike leaving poor reviews, especially for an item that in most respects is just about perfect.<br /><br />Yes, this case is high quality, extremely well made, and appears durable; it should last.  The material, though synthetic, is good and thick.  All the inside cut outs (the ones for your ID and credit cards) are reinforced with extra stitching.  The case itself has stitching all the way around; this adds an extra layer of security to hold the pieces of material together.  So much better than glue.<br /><br />The phone fits perfectly into the inside vinyl holder.  This holder helps protect your phone from drops.  All of that holder's cut out openings are spot on.  At the bottom there are openings for your charging cable, a small pin hole microphone, and your headphones.  Each cut out is perfectly centered.  On the right side are openings for your Power button and Volume controls.  Again each cut out is centered perfectly.  Plus they allow you access without any difficulty.  Some cases I've tried were difficult, the vinyl was too thick, or too narrow an opening; for them I had to set the top of my finger just right.  Not so with this case, with this one you put your finger on the button just perfectly - great case!<br /><br />The outer case has its own cutouts too.  On the back there are two cutouts.  One for your rear camera, one for the rear pin hole microphone.  Again they are perfectly aligned and centered.<br /><br />On the front, the front cover, there's one more cutout, for the phone's front speaker.  Unfortunately, the cutout is a few millimeters too high.  So your phone's speaker has no opening from which you can hear - when the case is closed.  Oh, you can still hear it ring, but it's muffled a tad because you're hearing it through the case's material, not through the Speaker cutout.  It's a shame for this case is what you want otherwise - well made, high quality, and durable.<br /><br />I do want to note that the item's photo shows the speaker cutout to be where it should be (about 6 mms from the stitching).  But on my item, that cutout is higher, just about 2 or 3 mms below the stitching, and since the width of the speaker is just about 2.5 mms, the speaker doesn't appear in the opening.<br /><br />Perhaps I received a bad one, or perhaps they're all like mine.  I do know that with new phones, the manufacturers work only with specifications, not a real phone.  So its easy to make a tiny error that has large ramifications.<br /><br />Anyway, I still like this case because these wallet cases can hold paper money, your ID, and important Cards.  This one would get five stars easy.  But with a bad cutout, it lost.<br /><br />Am I going to return it? Not this time - I'm traveling and need some sort of case.  The bad speaker cut out is a problem, but thankfully not major to me.  If you can live with it, buy this case.  It is one of the best.\n",

            "Review: I received this case last week.  When I open the Amazon box this was sealed in a plastic baggie/holder.  I opened it up and examined it.  The case was really nice, well made, protects my new phone, and allows me to carry my identification, my credit card, and paper money.<br /><br />It appears to be well made, no problems with the leather, nor the stitching.  The strap is separate, you can attach it or not.  I put my phone into the hard plastic frame - it fit perfectly.  There are holes cut out to give you access to the charging port, the on/off button, the power button, as well as the headphone jack.  It's a tight fit, and I feel the phone is really secure.<br /><br />The hard plastic holder is well secured, being completely attached to the leather case from it's entire right side.  This allows the phone to pivot partly out so you have complete access to the slot where you'd keep paper money.<br /><br />The case has a slot for your ID card, that slot comes with a clear covering so you don't need to remove your ID to show someone.  The clear cover also has an opening so you can use your thumb/finger to slide your ID out.  Above that slot are two more.  I use one for a credit card and the other to carry business cards.  I fit 25 cards in there without any problem.  The long slot holds my paper money.  You will need to fold your bills so they fit.  But once in there, they'll be secure.<br /><br />On the back of the holder is an opening for the camera lens and light.  There's also another small circular hole on the upper left, that (I'm guessing) is to help you remove the phone from the case. One could insert a tool to push against the back of the phone; this would dislodge it from the hard case, allowing you to remove your phone.  Personally, I don't think it's needed - I removed my phone just by bending the case a tad - that pushed out a corner of the phone, giving me the ability to remove it.<br /><br />The back also has a flap with a magnet.  This allows the cover to close and be held tightly and securely.  It's a strong magnet, and it does a great job of keeping the cover closed.  The front of the case has a cut out for the phone's speaker.  This allows you to hear the phone when it rings for calls or messages.<br /><br />They really thought of everything when they designed this case.  I'm really pleased with this case and I highly recommend it to anyone, male, female, or transgendered.  Plus, the Red color makes it easy to spot if I forget wherein placed it.  Again, I highly recommend this if your looking for a case that doubles as a wallet/purse.\n",

            "Review: I ordered this to cover my Galaxy Victory 4GLTE phone.  It does that but needs a little effort to get the corner everyone else talks about in here to grab on to the phone. This is a thin hard cover that works if you're not looking for a &#34;Iron-Man&#34; bullet proof container.  It fits well in your pocket not adding any bulk to the phone and protects the lens pretty well.  All outside plug ins are accessible and the case graphics are pretty awesome. There is some purple around the skull highlights that does not show in the Amazon image. It adds a nice depth to the graphic. The red eyes are a true red color and really makes the case come alive while not looking overdone and cheap.  Good for the price so stop reading this review now and buy it..........  well?\n",

New case being sent. That was all.<br />I give this thing two stars only because I think it would handle snow and dust fine but I'll never buy one for use in water again. In fact I'll never buy one again and I don't recommend anyone buy one either. Their advertising is misleading as is their website. It implies the case is Water proof, not resistant. Proof implies a guarantee, resistant would be more accurate. The lady that replied to my email actually said that the act of taking from or putting it back into a pocket could break the seal... I mean really? How the heck is that &#34;Life proof&#34;? Save your money...\n",

This case has saved me iPhones and iPads countless times from utter destruction.  I have briefly tried other cases but they have been unsatisfactory for several reasons.<br /><br />Reading other reviews. I see reports that this case does not work with wireless charging. It does at least wireless contact charging it does not work with MagSafe. I did have problems at first with glass screen savers they flat did not stay on. I finally discovered the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector sold here on Amazon. The first one was installed last April 2021 and it is still in place with no signs of comming loose.  The only problem I have with the Defender case is the tab that seals the hole to the lightning plug port. This is totally dependent on how frequently you move it but for me, it falls off after a bit over years of frequent use.  No big thing I just purchase a new case and continue on.\n",

I am very pleased with this battery I have my USB DMM to look at it's voltage and charge rate as you can see in the photo it us completely up to Apples spec's for charging. The fact that Anker includes an smart chip to control both the charging of this Battery pack and it's charging of the iOS device means no overheating and damage. The photo shows this battery charging my iPhone 6+ note the instrument readings exactly what you want to see.  5.10VDC, charging at 1.88 amp's. The only criticism I have is the really cheap and short micro USB cable this Battery comes with, for me this is not an issue I have lost count of the number of micro USB cables I have.

The Second set would not work as DIMMS and I could only use one 8 gig stick, the second stick would not let the MB handover to the  OS, this stick used alone showed the same &#34;10&#34; Q code and would not hand off.  Returned the second set for a refund and  purchased G-Skill Trident X on the recommendation of several gamers I know.  I am very pleased with the Corsair 750D case and Corsair Hi100GTX AIO but the DIMM's just didn't work out.\n",

            "Review: this is My go to heavy duty case, and the 6th Otterbox Defender case I have purchased for a succession of iPod Touch's, a couple for my iPad Air (1), and now a Gold iPhone 6+.  It is really a shame to put put these beautiful devices in a case but dropping a naked $959 dollar 6+ is not something you want to have happen. The iPhone 6+ is so slick and thin that you are worried it might slide out of you have with a moment of inattention.  The Defender solves this problem providing you with a very gripable heft and surface. The Defender case on the iPad Air has saved it from utter destruction at least 2 times and I expect it to protect this 6+ the same way. People have complained about an apparent gap between the screen saver and the iPhone 6's screen. In the first place I have never had a problem with this in any of the other Defender cases I have had. I checked the iPad and there is indeed a tiny gap, but until I looked for it I didn't even notice it.  There is at least one Youtube showing somebody removing the screen protector and re-gluing it.  there is a far easier solution if you think this is a problem. Which the lady down at the Verizon store turned me on to. The only reason why I have replaced Defender cases is if the plastic screen protector get too many scratches in it. or I have to take the iOS device out of the case to clean out dust and hair that might have got under it and the opening and closing loosens up the inner hard case so it doesn't latch properly anymore. The Verizon lady showed, and I had her install,  the Gadget Guard Black Ice, glass screen protector.  Very simple to do. You remove the plastic screen protector from the Defender case, it peels right off, next you clean the screen service, no finger prints, dust , etc. This glass screen protector is self adhesive with the supplied squeegee you careful place it and remove any bubbles. Because the Black Ice protector is attached directly to the glass screen nothing can get under it. You then you place the iPhone in the Defender case as you normally would. I am very pleased. The Black Ice screen protector is made for most of the Apple line up past and present. They even have them for the Mac Book computers. Gadget Defender is sold here on Amazon.<br /><br />Update 25 April 2016:<br />I had to replace my defender case with a new one.  I has given it's life protecting my iPhone 6+ from utter destruction at least 3 times.  The seal tabs on the bottom where getting kind of seedy but where still doing their job but the inner hard shell cracked from it last &#34;save&#34; so a replacement was in order. My iPhone remains in great shape. I only considered the Defender case why mess with a good thing.\n",

What I particularly like is the fact it is able to plug into My iPad Air that is encased in an OtterBox Defender case, and my iPod Touch 5 also in the same model case. The strain relief seems better then the Apple cable and the nylon braided covering should add to it's durability. Time will tell but I am hopeful.\n",

What the picture does not show very well is the control buttons are covered by a clear plastic shield that in no way inhibits the buttons functionality. This is great if you, or your children have sticky fingers.  It is Still easy to lose but at least with the leather cover it will be easier to spot. When I noted the size and thinness I realized the couch monster would eat it in hurry so I purchased two more Apple TV remotes as backup's just in case.\n",

As a business owners, we needed to keep in touch with home and with this charger we had enough power to do anything we wanted for days!  There was one day where it was overcast and the  charging was noticeably slower but it was better than nothing!  On sunny days we had  tablets fully charged in a couple hours.  It charges 2 things at the same time but be careful, dont  just leave your stuff full on in the sun, it can get hot and melt your phone/tablet.  Put the charger full on in the sun and keep your phone or whatever underneath, behind, shaded somewhere.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.\n",

I have had absolutely no problems with it and would recommend it to others.<br />UPDATE: This evening upon returning home I attempted to remove my cell phone from the holster. Using no more force than usual, I pressed on the tab that locks the cell phone in to the holster. This time for reasons unknown to me, the tab broke off. I had the holster on my belt all day today and removed the cell phone several times successfully without anything breaking. I did not happen to get the holster caught on anything at all today, so I have no clue as to why the tab snapped off this evening.<br /> I have glued it back on using a quality cyanoacrilate adhesive. I don't expect this will be a permanent repair at all. I am going to attempt to contact the manufacturer (Zizo Wireless) to see if they are willing to supply a replacement at this late date.<br /><br />UPDATE: As expected, Amazon deferred the issue to Zizo. Zizo informed me that the holsters are currently out of stock but stated that they will replace the item once it is available again.<br /><br />UPDATE: After waiting several months, I finally e-mailed the company again. This is the response I received:<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry but the holster is no more available on our website.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns.<br /> As a result, I'm down grading my evaluation to ZERO STARS. Don't waste your money on this item. It will eventually break and the company offers no support.\n",

But 99% of folks who are even remotely savvy can figure it out.<br /><br />It is much lighter than the Otterbox I had on previous phone but fits very well and is much easier to remove if you need to.  Screen saver went on easy with normal bubbles to rub out.  it is not the best part of product, but it is a &#34;screen saver&#34; and expected to trash soon.  All the buttons and openings are readily available and you don't have to pull little rubber tabs open and closed.  Maybe some dust can get in, but gosh sure is easy to use attaching cables.<br /><br />Overall for one day and installation I am quite satisfied with case.

In reality, i cannot put a wireless charger in every location i would normally charge my phone, such as in the car, so I planned to continue to also charge the phone sometimes with a wired charger.  The problem is that the case - while it plugs into the lightning port of my phone - then has a usb port for charging.  Thus to use wired charging for my phone - after installing the case - would require me to replace every one of my existing lightning charging cables with usb charging cables.  This is not cost effective and these usb cables would not work with my wife's phone.  If it had a lightning port for wired charging i would have kept the case, but since it does not i plan to return it.\n",

It is not soft like the description says, and it did not work for sensitive, rash-prone skin.<br />I will admit, if it weren't for the scratchy feeling and the almost immediate itchiness, it would be a good strap.

            "Review: I've dropped my iPhone umpteen times and it doesn't have a scratch or dent on it.  My otter box case is showing some wear and tear, but my phone is in great condition.  The phone, being glass, is slippery, I definitely have a better grip with this case. Some complain it is too bulky.  Sure, it's not nearly as the phone is, but at east I still have a phone.  I'm on my third iPhone.  This time I got the apple care warranty as well as this case, though I don't know that I'll need the warranty with this case.  One thing to note, this case is not waterproof, so dropping the phone in water will still damage it.  Also, one annoying thing is that I can't connect my phone to my stereo through the headphone jack while the case is on.  It may be the cord I'm using, but I have to take the case off completely to use the jack with the cable I have.  The earbuds and charging port work refectory though.\n",

Meanwhile I have been using the new stylus and it is a wonderful improvement over the rubber tip stylus I used in the past; and with six replacement tips, looks like we'll be partners for a long time.

There is a small metal pin that the clip hinges on, and it came out. I managed to put it back together, and get the spring in place. It is working, but I have to keep an eye on the pin. Honestly, if I just didn't like the case, and the way it holds the phone on the belt clip, I would be inclined to give a totally negative review. I'm just hoping to get as much time out of this case as possible. It's hard to find a case of any quality for the LG stylo 2.

            "Review: Ordered two of these cases for our new Galaxy S8 & S8 Plus.  They were guaranteed to be delivered Sunday 07 May.  I received them today, 08 May.  Phone went into the case easily.  However, the back and sides of the case are slippery.  Not as much as the phone itself, but enough that I'm still a bit nervous picking it up.  This is not the fault of the manufacturer.  Just my personal preference that the case I use not be slippery.  The hard plastic shell is the culprit. Guess I was spoiled by my Otterbox Defender that I had for my Galaxy S4 -- no slippage problems with THAT case !!!!\n",

It doesn’t take up much space and is barely noticeable. We put our phones on it when we go to bed and they are fully charged overnight.  When you put your phone on the charging pad a green light goes on to let you know you are charging. (Our phones also make a sound, but I don’t know if that is the case with all phones.). The only issue I have had is if I put both phones on the pad at the same time, I have had one phone not be properly placed, and it didn’t charge. I should have known it wasn’t placed correctly because the phone didn’t make a sound, but I missed it. Overall, I really like this product. Works well, especially for the price.\n",

The cover screws onto the opposite side of the stylus when you are using it, providing extra hand support. The tip itself has a plastic cover around it which helps support the small tip and provide some protection around it.<br /><br />The FIRST thing you should do is read the directions! I didn't and nearly broke the tip trying to take the plastic protective cover off of it. That plastic protective cover does not come off. As they say, read the directions.<br /><br />I tried it out on my Kindle and it worked perfectly, although there was a time lag between what I drew and when it appeared on the Kindle screen. It allows for finer detail then I have been used to on a touch screen.<br /><br />I was looking for a stylus which could draw fine detail on a touch screen and this seems to be it.<br />My 1st impression is that this is the best fine detail drawing stylus that I have ever used.<br />This is my 1st impression.\n",

            "Review: I just got this in. I am pretty sure that the vender would have sent this to me free to review if I had asked, but I purchased it instead to power my Kindle HD 7. I purchased it because of the power output. It puts out 2.4 amps per USB plug, and it has 2 plugs.<br /><br />First thing that I did was plug my Amazon Kindle into it. My Kindle has been reporting that the adapter which Amazon recommends for the Kindle is not providing enough power, so I ordered this one. And it works! No complaints from my Kindle.<br /><br />You can see from other reviews that it has a nice built-in nightlight. I figure that feature as eye-candy. It's main selling point in my opinion is the 4.8 amp total output producing 2.4 amps per plug. Another nice feature is that 110 v. plug hides away when you have it packed for traveling.\n",

I wanted to ditch the bag and went on a hunt for a slim wallet case that would do the trick. (I still have a wallet for all the cards, change... that I carry on occasion.) This thing snaps onto my phone snugly but easily. The holes and slots line up and I don't have interference with my camera. Bluetooth still works well. If I open the back door I can put my phone on the wireless charger and on my car mount. I hold my drivers license and one credit card. 90% of the time, that's all I need. Now I can slip my phone in my pocket and off I go. The door snaps closed and the front edge is raised just a wee bit, protecting my screen some without adding bulk. I think this thing will last - and if it doesn't, well hey. This is 1/3rd the cost of what they sell at the Verizon store.\n",

The case makes the phone quite a bit thicker and the front edges are raised, providing protection for the screen. All the holes and slots lined up nicely for the charger....<br />I did not stick with this case because of the heftiness of it. It made my very slim phone chunky. It did not fit into my pockets easily, I had trouble with wireless charging, and I could not use my phone holder in my car.<br />If you are looking for an alternative to an Otterbox, this should save some $$.\n",

            "Review: Once I got the app and sticker to work correctly, I loved my KnowRoaming sticker/app! The first sticker I ordered from Amazon did not work. So I had to contact customer support, they sent a new one, which I received the day before my trip abroad. I was in a panic, because there were no delivery options besides First Class USPS, all the way across the country from Niagra Falls to California. Installation of the sticker was easy, but getting the app to work was not. I Traveled from San Francisco to Vancouver, BC, had a 24 hour layover, and could not get the app to work. I only had WiFi at my AirB&B, other navigation was impossible, forgot an essential medication that required all my waking time to acquire in a different country. So, I had to wait until I landed in London, accomplished transit travel without navigation again, and settled once again in my AirB&B, to get WiFi, so that I could contact tech support over and over again, to get set up to use. I was so grateful to have navigation again, no time to go further with setup, before I was off to my next destination. Every time one changes county, region, country, one must go back to settings, ask what SIM am I on, reboot the phone, wait for connection, sometimes taking extraordinary amounts of time to do this several times. I could not make phone calls, as I did not want to use the ReachMe services to get political and telemarketing calls and texts while abroad, nor any nonessential calls and texts. WiFi on the trains was virtually impossible without purchasing lengthy times, and most times the data was reading NoService. The last long train trip I made, was an exercise in \"seconds count\", as I had attempted to contact a friend in Slovenia by emails, every means possible, until I was successful in setting up WhatsApp after much travail. We were able to communicate with seconds to spare to meet at the correct location. Once back home, I could not make or receive phone calls or texts for days, then the recommendation was to set my network statistics, which meant I ditched ALL my accounts and passwords saved in this phone. Uh, NO!<br />The support team at KnowRoaming was wonderful, replying quickly to my panic emails.<br />The cost? I have not added up as yet what I spent on data packages, but it was worth the peace of mind knowing that I could access, most of the time.<br />Many trials and tribulations with this sticker, I loved having access when I had it, but I think next time I go abroad, I would purchase the substitute SIM card, replace with my carrier's SIM when I return home, and be relatively assured that I would not have so much hassle with the sticker.\n",

Convenient providing Lightning, USB-C, and watch charging with one cable as long as you don't need to charge quickly.<br /><br />I tested charge rates using the \"Ampere Test\" app with an Apple 20W charger and battery optimization turned off on my iPhone. I rotated between this cable and the cable that is normal for the iPhone. The phone was about half charged. The Apple cable showed 19.6 watts. This cable showed a variety of charge rates: 9.8, 19.6, 7.8, and 13-watts results with tests interspersed with the faster Apple cable. I could not determine any pattern. It never failed to charge the phone. I did not test charging multiple devices simultaneously.\n",

            "Review: I have only had this abut a week, but I was pleased to find I could put my iPhone SE into it without removing it from its Otter Box Defender case.  The belt/sleeve holds the phone snuggly against my bicep, and if I put the phone in upside down, I can easily plug in the earphones or battery while it is riding in the sleeve.  Two things to be aware of; first this is a relatively tight sleeve.  It fits me perfectly but without much room to spare.  I am a medium sized woman without remarkable biceps, and many people (men especially) might find this too tight.  Second, I have found that the touch screen on the phone is not usable through the cover of this holder, on top of the defender cover. This is not a major problem for me as I as using it for working out and just set the phone up just as I want it before it goes in the sleeve, and I can answer phone calls if they come in on the earbud microphone.  So I just plan on not using the touch screen through these layers, but if you wanted to be able to do that you might feel disappointed.  Still, it has worked for me and I even got caught in a heavy rain and the phone stayed safe and dry. I am satisfied and have recommended it to others.\n",

These things use 18650 batteries which are powerful cells but 98% of what is on Amazon are Chinese firecrackers and sold for dirt cheap for a reason. These batteries don't have the proper circuitry protection like PCB and are the reason why pilots don't like them in their cargo... Hoverboards. I might check out a DIY kit that lets you use your own 18650 batteries or replace the battery in this Anker myself with a Nitecore if it's possible.<br /><br />Very disappointed. I had an older version with less power (3200mah I believe) that lasted much longer. I don't know if perhaps mine has a bad battery in it but it won't even fully charge one small phone.

The only thing that could be better is that the side trim pieces are not all the same width--only slightly off though. I haven had a couple of minor drops and no issues. The wood is much more slippery than the carbon fiber style skin though and something they could work on fixing.<br /><br />One trick with the final part of application with the hair dryer is to put the phone in a large gallon ziplock bag and seal the bag around the nozzle of the hair dryer. Then set it on low for a minute or two and then work in the corners. I found this much more effective as it heats up the entire skin. I have also used this method to bring back this phone from the dead when I dropped it in water--it was only in the water for one second but it wouldn't turn on but the bag trick worked well.\n",

            "Review: **updated review**<br /><br />After several hours of having the case charge it was finally fully charged. I popped my phone in turned it on and tell me why the case went from fully charged to just having 3 LED lights of charging..... MERP. I plugged the case back in with the phone attached and the case just went crazy with vibrating and not being able to charge the case while charging the phone. Idk if it’s a glitch or what, I mean it charges my phone but the other thing I don’t like is that the lights don’t stay on while using. I definitely have mixed feelings about this case...<br /><br />This review is strictly based off first impressions. I have not used it just yet, it’s in its 5 hour pre use charge still. Which it’s been charging for 3 hours so far and it still only has 3 solid LED lights the rest are still blinking.<br /><br />So first I’d like to start off that I love the feel of it. This is my second external battery case but from another company. I could do without the advertising on the back of the case but whatevs, as long as it does it’s job.<br /><br />I do want to point out that the case is a completely DIFFERENT design than it shows on the front of the box. The case is really thick around the camera area of the phone and I hope it doesn’t cast a shadow on my pics when I use the flash.<br /><br />On the back where the instructions are you can tell it’s talking about a different model because no where on this case does anything close or attach to anything. The whole case is just one piece which is fine with me, that’s how my last case was but the top was flexible to slide the phone in. Which takes me to my next point.. the directions clearlu state DO NOT CREATE AN ANGLE while taking phone in or out of case......... how can I not create an angle my phone just won’t pop in the case, it can’t.. it has the connector in the way.<br /><br />AGAIN this is just off first impressions, I still have high hopes for this but I just wish the case was what I thought I was purchasing.\n",

Initially, I was very pleased.<br /><br />However, after removing the lower portion a number of times, I began to notice cracks in the upper portion where the two sections interlock and now several small pieces have actually broken off the upper portion.<br /><br />Taking this case apart clearly stresses the plastic of the upper portion.

The charger cord did not fit my TomTom XXL 540S but I was able to wrap it out of the way and use my right-angled plug that came with the GPS, so that worked. IF I could have got it to stay in place it would be 5 star outstanding. It was by far the best \"idea\" I've seen or purchased. Really easy to unplug and put under seat in two seconds.

I've had other covers that require regular removal a cleaning but this one keeps the dirt out. It provides excellent protection, is not too bulky, fits in most pouches and looks stylish.<br />I only have one issue otherwise it would get 5 stars. It comes with a built in clear plastic screen protection which is required in order to provide a good environmental seal. The problem is that the clear plastic screen protection does not fit well, looks ugly and is not great to use. I am not too concerned about the environmental seal so in frustration ripped out the clear plastic. It requires quite a bit of force to do this (start in a corner with a blunt object) but eventually parts cleanly on the glue that is used to attach it and does not affect the look of the product at all. The residual glue inside the cover actually provides quite a good seal against the screen. I then installed the Tech Armor Balistic glass which fits perfectly with this cover.<br />If I was designing this product, I would remove the clear plastic screen cover or make it a removable option and add a silicone seal where it touches the screen so that it could seal onto a Balistic glass.\n",

Paperless is sometimes the pits! I don't even know how to made a call from it much less access my voicemail. No instructions included. For most I am sure it is a great product, ONLY it wouldn't be is because the keys on the message keyboard are too small and I have to repeatedly go back and correct typos.

You need to be able to cord charge with this case because it is sporadic when working with wireless charging pads. It didn’t work at all at first, then started working, now the battery drains faster for some reason and there’s not always a wireless charger around - so yet another reason to need to cord charge. I would not recommend nor buy again.\n",

The instructions are unreadable tiny print, so perhaps I missed how to turn it off when not in use. It should shut off automatically. The tiny cover for the charging port was easily lost. In use, it needed firm, steady pressure to retain contact. or you had to start over with a continuous line.<br />11/27/22 Ok. it does shut off automatically. The three blue lights stay on when I go to use it but the<br />pen still does not work.<br />12/2/22 I got some helpful advice from customer service, which helped me get this pen up and running. the pen does shut down automatically after a few minutes of non use. using the double tap method to turn the pen on or off only works intermittently. the instructions say that it works better if you have the tempered  glass screen protector installed. have this on my ipad.\n",

The phone worked well with his AT&T sim card and calls were clear. There was no problem with signal and call quality that is not normal for AT&T in this area.<br />The only problem with the phone was that it was hard for him to learn how to use it. With the lack of a real display and only a small window for text he had a hard time figuring out how to make calls. It took me a few minutes to figure the phone out and get numbers programmed into it for him also.  The interface is not very intuitive, even for me and I have degrees in IT.<br /><br />Overall the phone is excellent and works well.

            "Review: I have bought from LK before and they are a trusted brand, their stuff is durable and is sold at an affordable price, plus they come with a warranty.<br /><br />This product is a good case for an Apple Watch. It came well packaged and ready to use. The only thing is that it did not have an instruction sheet on how to put the case on, but there is a video detailing the process on their website and the Amazon page. The video might not be needed though, since it was a very easy and simple installation/putting it on the watch. Just clean it with the provided wipes and cloth, remove the dust, and the case is ready to go on. Pull the sticker off the case, line it up, start with the button side, and just snap it on.<br /><br />It protects the watch very well, each side and especially the screen. It does give some peace of mind having something to protect the watch screen since it is glass and could break if something were to hit it too hard. The sensitivity is good and it’s hard to tell a difference between using the watch screen with the case vs without the case.<br /><br />There are only 3 drawbacks with the product. One is that it makes it harder to hit the power button on the side. The plastic comes out and protects that area, but the button is recessed and lower than the surrounding plastic so it is not as convenient to click. Instead of just casually clicking the button as I would in the past I have to use my nail. This can be solved if the case is built like an iPhone case, where the power button usually has a rubber button extender on it making it easy to press. Hopefully future iterations will have that feature, but for now just know it takes some getting used to.<br /><br />One other drawback is a rainbow type dot/smudge appears between the watch and the protector. It moves around depending on how you press it, but it doesn’t go away.<br /><br />The third drawback is just being careful with it around water. I washed my hands with my watch on and some water got stuck between the watch and the case, and to get it out you have to take the case off and dry it, then put it on again.<br /><br />TLDR: This case is a great value for what you pay for it. It does a great job protecting it from physical damage and is as sensitive as the watch face is. It has a few flaws, but they are more slight inconveniences that do not detract from the safety of the watch. I would recommend getting this if you are looking for something to protect your watch from physical damage. Personally I prefer this over the film protectors, since the film protectors don't last long and are annoying to install.\n",

But the case holds well in my hand and protects the phone well.<br /><br />A final comment is that I'd not thought about how the case would NOT work to hold a popsocket or pop stand.  The multi-dimentioned back leaves too limited a space to get a good glue grip for that item.  I really wish the case had a larger flat surface on the back to permit such usage.\n",

It has a great self-actuating mechanism to close the grips around the phone's edges when it contacts that back wall of the mount. The clamps for the air vent are excellent & provide a very solid feel, significantly reducing the chance that it will fall off.<br /><br />The only delicate part of the installation is to get everything at just the right angles. You will likely need to use an iterative process to tighten & rotate the mount into position, as one can affect there other.

            "Review: Note that this is a flexible film, not the typical tempered glass screen protector, for the Samsung S22 Ultra in my case. Tempered glass did not work for me as it left a virtual hole in my screen for the fingerprint reader.<br /><br />If you follow the instruction video fully, you should have no trouble. It is very critical that you have a dust-free environment. Having said that, I ended up with 2 small dust specs that were not worth the trouble to fix. In fact, I can't even see them when the screen is on.<br /><br />You really need to do this when you have an overnight window to let the film dry & cure. I was concerned with the texture & graininess after installation, including some very small air bubbles. Per the instructions, these fully disappeared by morning. There is also a warning about needing to redo your fingerprints, as the film may make your existing fingerprints ineffective. In my case, I did not need to do this at all, my old fingerprints worked just fine. Bonus!<br /><br />Touch sensitivity is great, with a less frictionless surface than the original phone & tempered glass screen protectors. This will give you a slightly different feel but it is not an issue once you get used to it.<br /><br />Overall, a great value when the tempered glass options from other vendors did not do it for me.\n",

            "Review: This is a sturdy case and holds the phone very well. Wireless charging was not compromised. The sliding cover for the rear cameras might seem clunky to some but it really protects the protruding cameras. The sliding cover moves in a slot to the right of the cameras but stays within the width of the phone/case, no protrusions. Now I can lay the phone down without worry.<br /><br />You will have to remember to slide the cover open and to close it, as these are not typical actions when using a phone camera. The \"use Night mode\" camera screen prompt is your reminder to slide the door over if not already done. Just need to remember to close it afterwards.<br /><br />Additionally, the full-width design eliminates the wobble when lying flat.<br /><br />The case should have more of a rubbery grip feel. Having said that, it is still very good and greatly beats the super slippery design of the phone. Lastly, the S-Pen recess will require a fingernail or small finger to release it. I was not able to release it with my thumb. I don't use the pen, so not an issue for me, might be for some. Overall, a great product, compensating for suboptimal phone design, at least in my opinion, better than any of the others I researched.\n",

(You can look that up on the internet, so many reports of this issue).<br /><br />The provided tools made teardown really easy, but a word to the wise: Be careful to not slide any of the tools too far into the unit, only work the outside edges. I now have a pencil dot's worth of bad pixels, not too bad. The provided screwdriver is magnetic, making it really easy to pick up and place the screws for reinsertion. The spungers & plastic wedges were fine. The separation of my case back due to an expanded battery was so severe it made finding playing cards unnecessary, it was easy to gently peel off.<br /><br />I tried the phone without screwing things back to together to make sure it worked or putting the back on. It powered up fine out of the box, 50% charge, but I did have some network(s) connectivity issues. Putting the screws in and putting on the back worked, after apparently needing to do an extra reboot. The metal back may be proving antenna support/functionality. I did not see any instructions or links to instructions, the manufacturer may have a site for that. There are great videos on the internet that walk you through the entire process.\n",

I especially like the clip design, it holds the phone securely during the most energetic activity yet I have instant access to pull my phone up to remove the phone from the armband. That allows me to change my music, send a text, use an app, etc. then quickly slide the clip back into the holder on the armband without missing a beat. It is also extremely durable - the clip is strong and so far unbreakable, it is part of the case so there is no weak point at a connection. I've dropped it numerous times and the phone has never been damaged. The armband is a strong, yet somewhat stretchable neoprene - it last much longer than elastic, it's more comfortable, and it is amazingly &#34;stink&#34; resistant. All that and it is surprisingly less expensive than it's inferior competition.\n",

            "Review: I really dislike leaving poor reviews, especially for an item that in most respects is just about perfect.<br /><br />Yes, this case is high quality, extremely well made, and appears durable; it should last.  The material, though synthetic, is good and thick.  All the inside cut outs (the ones for your ID and credit cards) are reinforced with extra stitching.  The case itself has stitching all the way around; this adds an extra layer of security to hold the pieces of material together.  So much better than glue.<br /><br />The phone fits perfectly into the inside vinyl holder.  This holder helps protect your phone from drops.  All of that holder's cut out openings are spot on.  At the bottom there are openings for your charging cable, a small pin hole microphone, and your headphones.  Each cut out is perfectly centered.  On the right side are openings for your Power button and Volume controls.  Again each cut out is centered perfectly.  Plus they allow you access without any difficulty.  Some cases I've tried were difficult, the vinyl was too thick, or too narrow an opening; for them I had to set the top of my finger just right.  Not so with this case, with this one you put your finger on the button just perfectly - great case!<br /><br />The outer case has its own cutouts too.  On the back there are two cutouts.  One for your rear camera, one for the rear pin hole microphone.  Again they are perfectly aligned and centered.<br /><br />On the front, the front cover, there's one more cutout, for the phone's front speaker.  Unfortunately, the cutout is a few millimeters too high.  So your phone's speaker has no opening from which you can hear - when the case is closed.  Oh, you can still hear it ring, but it's muffled a tad because you're hearing it through the case's material, not through the Speaker cutout.  It's a shame for this case is what you want otherwise - well made, high quality, and durable.<br /><br />I do want to note that the item's photo shows the speaker cutout to be where it should be (about 6 mms from the stitching).  But on my item, that cutout is higher, just about 2 or 3 mms below the stitching, and since the width of the speaker is just about 2.5 mms, the speaker doesn't appear in the opening.<br /><br />Perhaps I received a bad one, or perhaps they're all like mine.  I do know that with new phones, the manufacturers work only with specifications, not a real phone.  So its easy to make a tiny error that has large ramifications.<br /><br />Anyway, I still like this case because these wallet cases can hold paper money, your ID, and important Cards.  This one would get five stars easy.  But with a bad cutout, it lost.<br /><br />Am I going to return it? Not this time - I'm traveling and need some sort of case.  The bad speaker cut out is a problem, but thankfully not major to me.  If you can live with it, buy this case.  It is one of the best.\n",

            "Review: I received this case last week.  When I open the Amazon box this was sealed in a plastic baggie/holder.  I opened it up and examined it.  The case was really nice, well made, protects my new phone, and allows me to carry my identification, my credit card, and paper money.<br /><br />It appears to be well made, no problems with the leather, nor the stitching.  The strap is separate, you can attach it or not.  I put my phone into the hard plastic frame - it fit perfectly.  There are holes cut out to give you access to the charging port, the on/off button, the power button, as well as the headphone jack.  It's a tight fit, and I feel the phone is really secure.<br /><br />The hard plastic holder is well secured, being completely attached to the leather case from it's entire right side.  This allows the phone to pivot partly out so you have complete access to the slot where you'd keep paper money.<br /><br />The case has a slot for your ID card, that slot comes with a clear covering so you don't need to remove your ID to show someone.  The clear cover also has an opening so you can use your thumb/finger to slide your ID out.  Above that slot are two more.  I use one for a credit card and the other to carry business cards.  I fit 25 cards in there without any problem.  The long slot holds my paper money.  You will need to fold your bills so they fit.  But once in there, they'll be secure.<br /><br />On the back of the holder is an opening for the camera lens and light.  There's also another small circular hole on the upper left, that (I'm guessing) is to help you remove the phone from the case. One could insert a tool to push against the back of the phone; this would dislodge it from the hard case, allowing you to remove your phone.  Personally, I don't think it's needed - I removed my phone just by bending the case a tad - that pushed out a corner of the phone, giving me the ability to remove it.<br /><br />The back also has a flap with a magnet.  This allows the cover to close and be held tightly and securely.  It's a strong magnet, and it does a great job of keeping the cover closed.  The front of the case has a cut out for the phone's speaker.  This allows you to hear the phone when it rings for calls or messages.<br /><br />They really thought of everything when they designed this case.  I'm really pleased with this case and I highly recommend it to anyone, male, female, or transgendered.  Plus, the Red color makes it easy to spot if I forget wherein placed it.  Again, I highly recommend this if your looking for a case that doubles as a wallet/purse.\n",

            "Review: I ordered this to cover my Galaxy Victory 4GLTE phone.  It does that but needs a little effort to get the corner everyone else talks about in here to grab on to the phone. This is a thin hard cover that works if you're not looking for a &#34;Iron-Man&#34; bullet proof container.  It fits well in your pocket not adding any bulk to the phone and protects the lens pretty well.  All outside plug ins are accessible and the case graphics are pretty awesome. There is some purple around the skull highlights that does not show in the Amazon image. It adds a nice depth to the graphic. The red eyes are a true red color and really makes the case come alive while not looking overdone and cheap.  Good for the price so stop reading this review now and buy it..........  well?\n",

ZERO SUPPORT! I was told they only warranty the plastic and rubber case from water damage, not the contents! Really? Please explain how water will damage the plastic mad rubber? No answer.

In fact I'll never buy one again and I don't recommend anyone buy one either. Their advertising is misleading as is their website. It implies the case is Water proof, not resistant. Proof implies a guarantee, resistant would be more accurate. The lady that replied to my email actually said that the act of taking from or putting it back into a pocket could break the seal...

This case has saved me iPhones and iPads countless times from utter destruction.  I have briefly tried other cases but they have been unsatisfactory for several reasons.<br /><br />Reading other reviews. I see reports that this case does not work with wireless charging. It does at least wireless contact charging it does not work with MagSafe. I did have problems at first with glass screen savers they flat did not stay on. I finally discovered the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector sold here on Amazon. The first one was installed last April 2021 and it is still in place with no signs of comming loose.  The only problem I have with the Defender case is the tab that seals the hole to the lightning plug port. This is totally dependent on how frequently you move it but for me, it falls off after a bit over years of frequent use.  No big thing I just purchase a new case and continue on.\n",

I am very pleased with this battery I have my USB DMM to look at it's voltage and charge rate as you can see in the photo it us completely up to Apples spec's for charging. The fact that Anker includes an smart chip to control both the charging of this Battery pack and it's charging of the iOS device means no overheating and damage. The photo shows this battery charging my iPhone 6+ note the instrument readings exactly what you want to see.  5.10VDC, charging at 1.88 amp's.

            "Review: this is My go to heavy duty case, and the 6th Otterbox Defender case I have purchased for a succession of iPod Touch's, a couple for my iPad Air (1), and now a Gold iPhone 6+.  It is really a shame to put put these beautiful devices in a case but dropping a naked $959 dollar 6+ is not something you want to have happen. The iPhone 6+ is so slick and thin that you are worried it might slide out of you have with a moment of inattention.  The Defender solves this problem providing you with a very gripable heft and surface. The Defender case on the iPad Air has saved it from utter destruction at least 2 times and I expect it to protect this 6+ the same way. People have complained about an apparent gap between the screen saver and the iPhone 6's screen. In the first place I have never had a problem with this in any of the other Defender cases I have had. I checked the iPad and there is indeed a tiny gap, but until I looked for it I didn't even notice it.  There is at least one Youtube showing somebody removing the screen protector and re-gluing it.  there is a far easier solution if you think this is a problem. Which the lady down at the Verizon store turned me on to. The only reason why I have replaced Defender cases is if the plastic screen protector get too many scratches in it. or I have to take the iOS device out of the case to clean out dust and hair that might have got under it and the opening and closing loosens up the inner hard case so it doesn't latch properly anymore. The Verizon lady showed, and I had her install,  the Gadget Guard Black Ice, glass screen protector.  Very simple to do. You remove the plastic screen protector from the Defender case, it peels right off, next you clean the screen service, no finger prints, dust , etc. This glass screen protector is self adhesive with the supplied squeegee you careful place it and remove any bubbles. Because the Black Ice protector is attached directly to the glass screen nothing can get under it. You then you place the iPhone in the Defender case as you normally would. I am very pleased. The Black Ice screen protector is made for most of the Apple line up past and present. They even have them for the Mac Book computers. Gadget Defender is sold here on Amazon.<br /><br />Update 25 April 2016:<br />I had to replace my defender case with a new one.  I has given it's life protecting my iPhone 6+ from utter destruction at least 3 times.  The seal tabs on the bottom where getting kind of seedy but where still doing their job but the inner hard shell cracked from it last &#34;save&#34; so a replacement was in order. My iPhone remains in great shape. I only considered the Defender case why mess with a good thing.\n",

As a business owners, we needed to keep in touch with home and with this charger we had enough power to do anything we wanted for days!  There was one day where it was overcast and the  charging was noticeably slower but it was better than nothing!  On sunny days we had  tablets fully charged in a couple hours.  It charges 2 things at the same time but be careful, dont  just leave your stuff full on in the sun, it can get hot and melt your phone/tablet.  Put the charger full on in the sun and keep your phone or whatever underneath, behind, shaded somewhere.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.\n",

            "Review: I have had this item for several months now. It has proven to be durable and good quality. I have had absolutely no problems with it and would recommend it to others.<br />UPDATE: This evening upon returning home I attempted to remove my cell phone from the holster. Using no more force than usual, I pressed on the tab that locks the cell phone in to the holster. This time for reasons unknown to me, the tab broke off. I had the holster on my belt all day today and removed the cell phone several times successfully without anything breaking. I did not happen to get the holster caught on anything at all today, so I have no clue as to why the tab snapped off this evening.<br /> I have glued it back on using a quality cyanoacrilate adhesive. I don't expect this will be a permanent repair at all. I am going to attempt to contact the manufacturer (Zizo Wireless) to see if they are willing to supply a replacement at this late date.<br /><br />UPDATE: As expected, Amazon deferred the issue to Zizo. Zizo informed me that the holsters are currently out of stock but stated that they will replace the item once it is available again.<br /><br />UPDATE: After waiting several months, I finally e-mailed the company again. This is the response I received:<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry but the holster is no more available on our website.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns.<br /> As a result, I'm down grading my evaluation to ZERO STARS. Don't waste your money on this item. It will eventually break and the company offers no support.\n",

Also, I don't see how a thicker screen protector like these Ferilinso would fit snugly with or under the edges of the case.  Very disappointed I need to return both.

In reality, i cannot put a wireless charger in every location i would normally charge my phone, such as in the car, so I planned to continue to also charge the phone sometimes with a wired charger.  The problem is that the case - while it plugs into the lightning port of my phone - then has a usb port for charging.  Thus to use wired charging for my phone - after installing the case - would require me to replace every one of my existing lightning charging cables with usb charging cables.  This is not cost effective and these usb cables would not work with my wife's phone.  If it had a lightning port for wired charging i would have kept the case, but since it does not i plan to return it.\n",

It is not soft like the description says, and it did not work for sensitive, rash-prone skin.<br />I will admit, if it weren't for the scratchy feeling and the almost immediate itchiness, it would be a good strap.

The phone, being glass, is slippery, I definitely have a better grip with this case. Some complain it is too bulky.  Sure, it's not nearly as the phone is, but at east I still have a phone.  I'm on my third iPhone.  This time I got the apple care warranty as well as this case, though I don't know that I'll need the warranty with this case.  One thing to note, this case is not waterproof, so dropping the phone in water will still damage it.  Also, one annoying thing is that I can't connect my phone to my stereo through the headphone jack while the case is on.  It may be the cord I'm using, but I have to take the case off completely to use the jack with the cable I have.  The earbuds and charging port work refectory though.\n",

Meanwhile I have been using the new stylus and it is a wonderful improvement over the rubber tip stylus I used in the past; and with six replacement tips, looks like we'll be partners for a long time.

There is a small metal pin that the clip hinges on, and it came out. I managed to put it back together, and get the spring in place. It is working, but I have to keep an eye on the pin. Honestly, if I just didn't like the case, and the way it holds the phone on the belt clip, I would be inclined to give a totally negative review. I'm just hoping to get as much time out of this case as possible. It's hard to find a case of any quality for the LG stylo 2. This has been the best one that I've tried so far, beccause Otter Box doesn't offer one for this phone. At least, not with a belt clip.\n",

Phone went into the case easily.  However, the back and sides of the case are slippery.  Not as much as the phone itself, but enough that I'm still a bit nervous picking it up.  This is not the fault of the manufacturer.  Just my personal preference that the case I use not be slippery.  The hard plastic shell is the culprit.

When you put your phone on the charging pad a green light goes on to let you know you are charging. (Our phones also make a sound, but I don’t know if that is the case with all phones.). The only issue I have had is if I put both phones on the pad at the same time, I have had one phone not be properly placed, and it didn’t charge. I should have known it wasn’t placed correctly because the phone didn’t make a sound, but I missed it. Overall, I really like this product. Works well, especially for the price.\n",

            "Review: I just got this in and I am impressed. The stylus comes in with two extra tips and a metal cover to go over the tip when it is not in use. The cover screws onto the opposite side of the stylus when you are using it, providing extra hand support. The tip itself has a plastic cover around it which helps support the small tip and provide some protection around it.<br /><br />The FIRST thing you should do is read the directions! I didn't and nearly broke the tip trying to take the plastic protective cover off of it. That plastic protective cover does not come off. As they say, read the directions.<br /><br />I tried it out on my Kindle and it worked perfectly, although there was a time lag between what I drew and when it appeared on the Kindle screen. It allows for finer detail then I have been used to on a touch screen.<br /><br />I was looking for a stylus which could draw fine detail on a touch screen and this seems to be it.<br />My 1st impression is that this is the best fine detail drawing stylus that I have ever used.<br />This is my 1st impression.\n",

            "Review: I just got this in. I am pretty sure that the vender would have sent this to me free to review if I had asked, but I purchased it instead to power my Kindle HD 7. I purchased it because of the power output. It puts out 2.4 amps per USB plug, and it has 2 plugs.<br /><br />First thing that I did was plug my Amazon Kindle into it. My Kindle has been reporting that the adapter which Amazon recommends for the Kindle is not providing enough power, so I ordered this one. And it works! No complaints from my Kindle.<br /><br />You can see from other reviews that it has a nice built-in nightlight. I figure that feature as eye-candy. It's main selling point in my opinion is the 4.8 amp total output producing 2.4 amps per plug. Another nice feature is that 110 v. plug hides away when you have it packed for traveling.\n",

            "Review: Once I got the app and sticker to work correctly, I loved my KnowRoaming sticker/app! The first sticker I ordered from Amazon did not work. So I had to contact customer support, they sent a new one, which I received the day before my trip abroad. I was in a panic, because there were no delivery options besides First Class USPS, all the way across the country from Niagra Falls to California. Installation of the sticker was easy, but getting the app to work was not. I Traveled from San Francisco to Vancouver, BC, had a 24 hour layover, and could not get the app to work. I only had WiFi at my AirB&B, other navigation was impossible, forgot an essential medication that required all my waking time to acquire in a different country. So, I had to wait until I landed in London, accomplished transit travel without navigation again, and settled once again in my AirB&B, to get WiFi, so that I could contact tech support over and over again, to get set up to use. I was so grateful to have navigation again, no time to go further with setup, before I was off to my next destination. Every time one changes county, region, country, one must go back to settings, ask what SIM am I on, reboot the phone, wait for connection, sometimes taking extraordinary amounts of time to do this several times. I could not make phone calls, as I did not want to use the ReachMe services to get political and telemarketing calls and texts while abroad, nor any nonessential calls and texts. WiFi on the trains was virtually impossible without purchasing lengthy times, and most times the data was reading NoService. The last long train trip I made, was an exercise in \"seconds count\", as I had attempted to contact a friend in Slovenia by emails, every means possible, until I was successful in setting up WhatsApp after much travail. We were able to communicate with seconds to spare to meet at the correct location. Once back home, I could not make or receive phone calls or texts for days, then the recommendation was to set my network statistics, which meant I ditched ALL my accounts and passwords saved in this phone. Uh, NO!<br />The support team at KnowRoaming was wonderful, replying quickly to my panic emails.<br />The cost? I have not added up as yet what I spent on data packages, but it was worth the peace of mind knowing that I could access, most of the time.<br />Many trials and tribulations with this sticker, I loved having access when I had it, but I think next time I go abroad, I would purchase the substitute SIM card, replace with my carrier's SIM when I return home, and be relatively assured that I would not have so much hassle with the sticker.\n",

Too early to tell how durable it will be but the first one I bought for my S9 lasted about 3 months, was replaced under warranty, and the second has done well for for almost 2 year now.\n",

            "Review: I have only had this abut a week, but I was pleased to find I could put my iPhone SE into it without removing it from its Otter Box Defender case.  The belt/sleeve holds the phone snuggly against my bicep, and if I put the phone in upside down, I can easily plug in the earphones or battery while it is riding in the sleeve.  Two things to be aware of; first this is a relatively tight sleeve.  It fits me perfectly but without much room to spare.  I am a medium sized woman without remarkable biceps, and many people (men especially) might find this too tight.  Second, I have found that the touch screen on the phone is not usable through the cover of this holder, on top of the defender cover. This is not a major problem for me as I as using it for working out and just set the phone up just as I want it before it goes in the sleeve, and I can answer phone calls if they come in on the earbud microphone.  So I just plan on not using the touch screen through these layers, but if you wanted to be able to do that you might feel disappointed.  Still, it has worked for me and I even got caught in a heavy rain and the phone stayed safe and dry. I am satisfied and have recommended it to others.\n",

These things use 18650 batteries which are powerful cells but 98% of what is on Amazon are Chinese firecrackers and sold for dirt cheap for a reason. These batteries don't have the proper circuitry protection like PCB and are the reason why pilots don't like them in their cargo... Hoverboards. I might check out a DIY kit that lets you use your own 18650 batteries or replace the battery in this Anker myself with a Nitecore if it's possible.<br /><br />Very disappointed. I had an older version with less power (3200mah I believe) that lasted much longer. I don't know if perhaps mine has a bad battery in it but it won't even fully charge one small phone. The old one could charge devices 3 to 4 times but I gave it to someone.\n",

I have tried other products,  but for my ASUS MEMO 7&#34; tablet, which I use as my GPS,  at best I could only hope for the battery to stay at its current level, or slow the drain. But the SCOSCHE will charge the tablet and my phone while both are under heavy usage.  It's also very small and barely protrudes from the outlet. I just bought a second one for my wife's car.  It's also handy that they are universal in terms of device or brand and that the same cables we use at home will also work in the car.\n",

The only thing that could be better is that the side trim pieces are not all the same width--only slightly off though. I haven had a couple of minor drops and no issues. The wood is much more slippery than the carbon fiber style skin though and something they could work on fixing.<br /><br />One trick with the final part of application with the hair dryer is to put the phone in a large gallon ziplock bag and seal the bag around the nozzle of the hair dryer. Then set it on low for a minute or two and then work in the corners. I found this much more effective as it heats up the entire skin. I have also used this method to bring back this phone from the dead when I dropped it in water--it was only in the water for one second but it wouldn't turn on but the bag trick worked well.\n",

I’ve been working with a Winnie who has been really helpful.<br /><br />The screen works as it is advertised. It does protect the phone. The ability to work the iPhone screen is seem less. My only hope is that in the future they work through a few things to allow us to clean certain kinds of marks from the screen. This is the only reason I didn’t give it five stars.\n",

One or both ends are far too easy to detach.  Not at all useful for my kind of use case.\n",

            "Review: **updated review**<br /><br />After several hours of having the case charge it was finally fully charged. I popped my phone in turned it on and tell me why the case went from fully charged to just having 3 LED lights of charging..... MERP. I plugged the case back in with the phone attached and the case just went crazy with vibrating and not being able to charge the case while charging the phone. Idk if it’s a glitch or what, I mean it charges my phone but the other thing I don’t like is that the lights don’t stay on while using. I definitely have mixed feelings about this case...<br /><br />This review is strictly based off first impressions. I have not used it just yet, it’s in its 5 hour pre use charge still. Which it’s been charging for 3 hours so far and it still only has 3 solid LED lights the rest are still blinking.<br /><br />So first I’d like to start off that I love the feel of it. This is my second external battery case but from another company. I could do without the advertising on the back of the case but whatevs, as long as it does it’s job.<br /><br />I do want to point out that the case is a completely DIFFERENT design than it shows on the front of the box. The case is really thick around the camera area of the phone and I hope it doesn’t cast a shadow on my pics when I use the flash.<br /><br />On the back where the instructions are you can tell it’s talking about a different model because no where on this case does anything close or attach to anything. The whole case is just one piece which is fine with me, that’s how my last case was but the top was flexible to slide the phone in. Which takes me to my next point.. the directions clearlu state DO NOT CREATE AN ANGLE while taking phone in or out of case......... how can I not create an angle my phone just won’t pop in the case, it can’t.. it has the connector in the way.<br /><br />AGAIN this is just off first impressions, I still have high hopes for this but I just wish the case was what I thought I was purchasing.\n",

I also got the case largely for its other feature, a removable lower portion to make for easier docking. I also like it's looks! Initially, I was very pleased.<br /><br />However, after removing the lower portion a number of times, I began to notice cracks in the upper portion where the two sections interlock and now several small pieces have actually broken off the upper portion.<br /><br />Taking this case apart clearly stresses the plastic of the upper portion.

The charger cord did not fit my TomTom XXL 540S but I was able to wrap it out of the way and use my right-angled plug that came with the GPS, so that worked. IF I could have got it to stay in place it would be 5 star outstanding. It was by far the best \"idea\" I've seen or purchased. Really easy to unplug and put under seat in two seconds.

I've had other covers that require regular removal a cleaning but this one keeps the dirt out. It provides excellent protection, is not too bulky, fits in most pouches and looks stylish.<br />I only have one issue otherwise it would get 5 stars. It comes with a built in clear plastic screen protection which is required in order to provide a good environmental seal. The problem is that the clear plastic screen protection does not fit well, looks ugly and is not great to use. I am not too concerned about the environmental seal so in frustration ripped out the clear plastic. It requires quite a bit of force to do this (start in a corner with a blunt object) but eventually parts cleanly on the glue that is used to attach it and does not affect the look of the product at all. The residual glue inside the cover actually provides quite a good seal against the screen. I then installed the Tech Armor Balistic glass which fits perfectly with this cover.<br />If I was designing this product, I would remove the clear plastic screen cover or make it a removable option and add a silicone seal where it touches the screen so that it could seal onto a Balistic glass.\n",

You need to be able to cord charge with this case because it is sporadic when working with wireless charging pads. It didn’t work at all at first, then started working, now the battery drains faster for some reason and there’s not always a wireless charger around - so yet another reason to need to cord charge. I would not recommend nor buy again.\n",

The instructions are unreadable tiny print, so perhaps I missed how to turn it off when not in use. It should shut off automatically. The tiny cover for the charging port was easily lost. In use, it needed firm, steady pressure to retain contact. or you had to start over with a continuous line.<br />11/27/22 Ok. it does shut off automatically. The three blue lights stay on when I go to use it but the<br />pen still does not work.<br />12/2/22 I got some helpful advice from customer service, which helped me get this pen up and running. the pen does shut down automatically after a few minutes of non use. using the double tap method to turn the pen on or off only works intermittently. the instructions say that it works better if you have the tempered  glass screen protector installed. have this on my ipad.\n",

The phone worked well with his AT&T sim card and calls were clear. There was no problem with signal and call quality that is not normal for AT&T in this area.<br />The only problem with the phone was that it was hard for him to learn how to use it. With the lack of a real display and only a small window for text he had a hard time figuring out how to make calls. It took me a few minutes to figure the phone out and get numbers programmed into it for him also.  The interface is not very intuitive, even for me and I have degrees in IT.<br /><br />Overall the phone is excellent and works well.

            "Review: I have bought from LK before and they are a trusted brand, their stuff is durable and is sold at an affordable price, plus they come with a warranty.<br /><br />This product is a good case for an Apple Watch. It came well packaged and ready to use. The only thing is that it did not have an instruction sheet on how to put the case on, but there is a video detailing the process on their website and the Amazon page. The video might not be needed though, since it was a very easy and simple installation/putting it on the watch. Just clean it with the provided wipes and cloth, remove the dust, and the case is ready to go on. Pull the sticker off the case, line it up, start with the button side, and just snap it on.<br /><br />It protects the watch very well, each side and especially the screen. It does give some peace of mind having something to protect the watch screen since it is glass and could break if something were to hit it too hard. The sensitivity is good and it’s hard to tell a difference between using the watch screen with the case vs without the case.<br /><br />There are only 3 drawbacks with the product. One is that it makes it harder to hit the power button on the side. The plastic comes out and protects that area, but the button is recessed and lower than the surrounding plastic so it is not as convenient to click. Instead of just casually clicking the button as I would in the past I have to use my nail. This can be solved if the case is built like an iPhone case, where the power button usually has a rubber button extender on it making it easy to press. Hopefully future iterations will have that feature, but for now just know it takes some getting used to.<br /><br />One other drawback is a rainbow type dot/smudge appears between the watch and the protector. It moves around depending on how you press it, but it doesn’t go away.<br /><br />The third drawback is just being careful with it around water. I washed my hands with my watch on and some water got stuck between the watch and the case, and to get it out you have to take the case off and dry it, then put it on again.<br /><br />TLDR: This case is a great value for what you pay for it. It does a great job protecting it from physical damage and is as sensitive as the watch face is. It has a few flaws, but they are more slight inconveniences that do not detract from the safety of the watch. I would recommend getting this if you are looking for something to protect your watch from physical damage. Personally I prefer this over the film protectors, since the film protectors don't last long and are annoying to install.\n",

I DO wish that the top and bottom bumpers that extend above the S8+ screen extended even further.  But the case holds well in my hand and protects the phone well.<br /><br />A final comment is that I'd not thought about how the case would NOT work to hold a popsocket or pop stand.  The multi-dimentioned back leaves too limited a space to get a good glue grip for that item.  I really wish the case had a larger flat surface on the back to permit such usage.\n",

If this item were made of durable, plyable rubber and metal instead of plastic, I would definitely recommend it.  Since it does not, I returned it.\n",

It has a great self-actuating mechanism to close the grips around the phone's edges when it contacts that back wall of the mount. The clamps for the air vent are excellent & provide a very solid feel, significantly reducing the chance that it will fall off.<br /><br />The only delicate part of the installation is to get everything at just the right angles. You will likely need to use an iterative process to tighten & rotate the mount into position, as one can affect there other.

            "Review: Note that this is a flexible film, not the typical tempered glass screen protector, for the Samsung S22 Ultra in my case. Tempered glass did not work for me as it left a virtual hole in my screen for the fingerprint reader.<br /><br />If you follow the instruction video fully, you should have no trouble. It is very critical that you have a dust-free environment. Having said that, I ended up with 2 small dust specs that were not worth the trouble to fix. In fact, I can't even see them when the screen is on.<br /><br />You really need to do this when you have an overnight window to let the film dry & cure. I was concerned with the texture & graininess after installation, including some very small air bubbles. Per the instructions, these fully disappeared by morning. There is also a warning about needing to redo your fingerprints, as the film may make your existing fingerprints ineffective. In my case, I did not need to do this at all, my old fingerprints worked just fine. Bonus!<br /><br />Touch sensitivity is great, with a less frictionless surface than the original phone & tempered glass screen protectors. This will give you a slightly different feel but it is not an issue once you get used to it.<br /><br />Overall, a great value when the tempered glass options from other vendors did not do it for me.\n",

            "Review: This is a sturdy case and holds the phone very well. Wireless charging was not compromised. The sliding cover for the rear cameras might seem clunky to some but it really protects the protruding cameras. The sliding cover moves in a slot to the right of the cameras but stays within the width of the phone/case, no protrusions. Now I can lay the phone down without worry.<br /><br />You will have to remember to slide the cover open and to close it, as these are not typical actions when using a phone camera. The \"use Night mode\" camera screen prompt is your reminder to slide the door over if not already done. Just need to remember to close it afterwards.<br /><br />Additionally, the full-width design eliminates the wobble when lying flat.<br /><br />The case should have more of a rubbery grip feel. Having said that, it is still very good and greatly beats the super slippery design of the phone. Lastly, the S-Pen recess will require a fingernail or small finger to release it. I was not able to release it with my thumb. I don't use the pen, so not an issue for me, might be for some. Overall, a great product, compensating for suboptimal phone design, at least in my opinion, better than any of the others I researched.\n",

The separation of my case back due to an expanded battery was so severe it made finding playing cards unnecessary, it was easy to gently peel off.<br /><br />I tried the phone without screwing things back to together to make sure it worked or putting the back on. It powered up fine out of the box, 50% charge, but I did have some network(s) connectivity issues. Putting the screws in and putting on the back worked, after apparently needing to do an extra reboot. The metal back may be proving antenna support/functionality. I did not see any instructions or links to instructions, the manufacturer may have a site for that. There are great videos on the internet that walk you through the entire process.\n",

I especially like the clip design, it holds the phone securely during the most energetic activity yet I have instant access to pull my phone up to remove the phone from the armband. That allows me to change my music, send a text, use an app, etc. then quickly slide the clip back into the holder on the armband without missing a beat. It is also extremely durable - the clip is strong and so far unbreakable, it is part of the case so there is no weak point at a connection. I've dropped it numerous times and the phone has never been damaged. The armband is a strong, yet somewhat stretchable neoprene - it last much longer than elastic, it's more comfortable, and it is amazingly &#34;stink&#34; resistant. All that and it is surprisingly less expensive than it's inferior competition.\n",

            "Review: I really dislike leaving poor reviews, especially for an item that in most respects is just about perfect.<br /><br />Yes, this case is high quality, extremely well made, and appears durable; it should last.  The material, though synthetic, is good and thick.  All the inside cut outs (the ones for your ID and credit cards) are reinforced with extra stitching.  The case itself has stitching all the way around; this adds an extra layer of security to hold the pieces of material together.  So much better than glue.<br /><br />The phone fits perfectly into the inside vinyl holder.  This holder helps protect your phone from drops.  All of that holder's cut out openings are spot on.  At the bottom there are openings for your charging cable, a small pin hole microphone, and your headphones.  Each cut out is perfectly centered.  On the right side are openings for your Power button and Volume controls.  Again each cut out is centered perfectly.  Plus they allow you access without any difficulty.  Some cases I've tried were difficult, the vinyl was too thick, or too narrow an opening; for them I had to set the top of my finger just right.  Not so with this case, with this one you put your finger on the button just perfectly - great case!<br /><br />The outer case has its own cutouts too.  On the back there are two cutouts.  One for your rear camera, one for the rear pin hole microphone.  Again they are perfectly aligned and centered.<br /><br />On the front, the front cover, there's one more cutout, for the phone's front speaker.  Unfortunately, the cutout is a few millimeters too high.  So your phone's speaker has no opening from which you can hear - when the case is closed.  Oh, you can still hear it ring, but it's muffled a tad because you're hearing it through the case's material, not through the Speaker cutout.  It's a shame for this case is what you want otherwise - well made, high quality, and durable.<br /><br />I do want to note that the item's photo shows the speaker cutout to be where it should be (about 6 mms from the stitching).  But on my item, that cutout is higher, just about 2 or 3 mms below the stitching, and since the width of the speaker is just about 2.5 mms, the speaker doesn't appear in the opening.<br /><br />Perhaps I received a bad one, or perhaps they're all like mine.  I do know that with new phones, the manufacturers work only with specifications, not a real phone.  So its easy to make a tiny error that has large ramifications.<br /><br />Anyway, I still like this case because these wallet cases can hold paper money, your ID, and important Cards.  This one would get five stars easy.  But with a bad cutout, it lost.<br /><br />Am I going to return it? Not this time - I'm traveling and need some sort of case.  The bad speaker cut out is a problem, but thankfully not major to me.  If you can live with it, buy this case.  It is one of the best.\n",

            "Review: I received this case last week.  When I open the Amazon box this was sealed in a plastic baggie/holder.  I opened it up and examined it.  The case was really nice, well made, protects my new phone, and allows me to carry my identification, my credit card, and paper money.<br /><br />It appears to be well made, no problems with the leather, nor the stitching.  The strap is separate, you can attach it or not.  I put my phone into the hard plastic frame - it fit perfectly.  There are holes cut out to give you access to the charging port, the on/off button, the power button, as well as the headphone jack.  It's a tight fit, and I feel the phone is really secure.<br /><br />The hard plastic holder is well secured, being completely attached to the leather case from it's entire right side.  This allows the phone to pivot partly out so you have complete access to the slot where you'd keep paper money.<br /><br />The case has a slot for your ID card, that slot comes with a clear covering so you don't need to remove your ID to show someone.  The clear cover also has an opening so you can use your thumb/finger to slide your ID out.  Above that slot are two more.  I use one for a credit card and the other to carry business cards.  I fit 25 cards in there without any problem.  The long slot holds my paper money.  You will need to fold your bills so they fit.  But once in there, they'll be secure.<br /><br />On the back of the holder is an opening for the camera lens and light.  There's also another small circular hole on the upper left, that (I'm guessing) is to help you remove the phone from the case. One could insert a tool to push against the back of the phone; this would dislodge it from the hard case, allowing you to remove your phone.  Personally, I don't think it's needed - I removed my phone just by bending the case a tad - that pushed out a corner of the phone, giving me the ability to remove it.<br /><br />The back also has a flap with a magnet.  This allows the cover to close and be held tightly and securely.  It's a strong magnet, and it does a great job of keeping the cover closed.  The front of the case has a cut out for the phone's speaker.  This allows you to hear the phone when it rings for calls or messages.<br /><br />They really thought of everything when they designed this case.  I'm really pleased with this case and I highly recommend it to anyone, male, female, or transgendered.  Plus, the Red color makes it easy to spot if I forget wherein placed it.  Again, I highly recommend this if your looking for a case that doubles as a wallet/purse.\n",

            "Review: I ordered this to cover my Galaxy Victory 4GLTE phone.  It does that but needs a little effort to get the corner everyone else talks about in here to grab on to the phone. This is a thin hard cover that works if you're not looking for a &#34;Iron-Man&#34; bullet proof container.  It fits well in your pocket not adding any bulk to the phone and protects the lens pretty well.  All outside plug ins are accessible and the case graphics are pretty awesome. There is some purple around the skull highlights that does not show in the Amazon image. It adds a nice depth to the graphic. The red eyes are a true red color and really makes the case come alive while not looking overdone and cheap.  Good for the price so stop reading this review now and buy it..........  well?\n",

In fact I'll never buy one again and I don't recommend anyone buy one either. Their advertising is misleading as is their website. It implies the case is Water proof, not resistant. Proof implies a guarantee, resistant would be more accurate. The lady that replied to my email actually said that the act of taking from or putting it back into a pocket could break the seal...

This case has saved me iPhones and iPads countless times from utter destruction.  I have briefly tried other cases but they have been unsatisfactory for several reasons.<br /><br />Reading other reviews. I see reports that this case does not work with wireless charging. It does at least wireless contact charging it does not work with MagSafe. I did have problems at first with glass screen savers they flat did not stay on. I finally discovered the Spigen Tempered Glass Screen Protector sold here on Amazon. The first one was installed last April 2021 and it is still in place with no signs of comming loose.  The only problem I have with the Defender case is the tab that seals the hole to the lightning plug port. This is totally dependent on how frequently you move it but for me, it falls off after a bit over years of frequent use.  No big thing I just purchase a new case and continue on.\n",

I am very pleased with this battery I have my USB DMM to look at it's voltage and charge rate as you can see in the photo it us completely up to Apples spec's for charging. The fact that Anker includes an smart chip to control both the charging of this Battery pack and it's charging of the iOS device means no overheating and damage. The photo shows this battery charging my iPhone 6+ note the instrument readings exactly what you want to see.  5.10VDC, charging at 1.88 amp's. The only criticism I have is the really cheap and short micro USB cable this Battery comes with, for me this is not an issue I have lost count of the number of micro USB cables I have.

            "Review: this is My go to heavy duty case, and the 6th Otterbox Defender case I have purchased for a succession of iPod Touch's, a couple for my iPad Air (1), and now a Gold iPhone 6+.  It is really a shame to put put these beautiful devices in a case but dropping a naked $959 dollar 6+ is not something you want to have happen. The iPhone 6+ is so slick and thin that you are worried it might slide out of you have with a moment of inattention.  The Defender solves this problem providing you with a very gripable heft and surface. The Defender case on the iPad Air has saved it from utter destruction at least 2 times and I expect it to protect this 6+ the same way. People have complained about an apparent gap between the screen saver and the iPhone 6's screen. In the first place I have never had a problem with this in any of the other Defender cases I have had. I checked the iPad and there is indeed a tiny gap, but until I looked for it I didn't even notice it.  There is at least one Youtube showing somebody removing the screen protector and re-gluing it.  there is a far easier solution if you think this is a problem. Which the lady down at the Verizon store turned me on to. The only reason why I have replaced Defender cases is if the plastic screen protector get too many scratches in it. or I have to take the iOS device out of the case to clean out dust and hair that might have got under it and the opening and closing loosens up the inner hard case so it doesn't latch properly anymore. The Verizon lady showed, and I had her install,  the Gadget Guard Black Ice, glass screen protector.  Very simple to do. You remove the plastic screen protector from the Defender case, it peels right off, next you clean the screen service, no finger prints, dust , etc. This glass screen protector is self adhesive with the supplied squeegee you careful place it and remove any bubbles. Because the Black Ice protector is attached directly to the glass screen nothing can get under it. You then you place the iPhone in the Defender case as you normally would. I am very pleased. The Black Ice screen protector is made for most of the Apple line up past and present. They even have them for the Mac Book computers. Gadget Defender is sold here on Amazon.<br /><br />Update 25 April 2016:<br />I had to replace my defender case with a new one.  I has given it's life protecting my iPhone 6+ from utter destruction at least 3 times.  The seal tabs on the bottom where getting kind of seedy but where still doing their job but the inner hard shell cracked from it last &#34;save&#34; so a replacement was in order. My iPhone remains in great shape. I only considered the Defender case why mess with a good thing.\n",

Maybe if you're only planning on using it in controlled environments while at rest it would be fine. But if you want to use it in more active situations look elsewhere.\n",

As a business owners, we needed to keep in touch with home and with this charger we had enough power to do anything we wanted for days!  There was one day where it was overcast and the  charging was noticeably slower but it was better than nothing!  On sunny days we had  tablets fully charged in a couple hours.  It charges 2 things at the same time but be careful, dont  just leave your stuff full on in the sun, it can get hot and melt your phone/tablet.  Put the charger full on in the sun and keep your phone or whatever underneath, behind, shaded somewhere.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.\n",

            "Review: I have had this item for several months now. It has proven to be durable and good quality. I have had absolutely no problems with it and would recommend it to others.<br />UPDATE: This evening upon returning home I attempted to remove my cell phone from the holster. Using no more force than usual, I pressed on the tab that locks the cell phone in to the holster. This time for reasons unknown to me, the tab broke off. I had the holster on my belt all day today and removed the cell phone several times successfully without anything breaking. I did not happen to get the holster caught on anything at all today, so I have no clue as to why the tab snapped off this evening.<br /> I have glued it back on using a quality cyanoacrilate adhesive. I don't expect this will be a permanent repair at all. I am going to attempt to contact the manufacturer (Zizo Wireless) to see if they are willing to supply a replacement at this late date.<br /><br />UPDATE: As expected, Amazon deferred the issue to Zizo. Zizo informed me that the holsters are currently out of stock but stated that they will replace the item once it is available again.<br /><br />UPDATE: After waiting several months, I finally e-mailed the company again. This is the response I received:<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. We are sorry but the holster is no more available on our website.<br /><br />Looking forward to hearing from you.<br /><br />Please reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns.<br /> As a result, I'm down grading my evaluation to ZERO STARS. Don't waste your money on this item. It will eventually break and the company offers no support.\n",

Also, I don't see how a thicker screen protector like these Ferilinso would fit snugly with or under the edges of the case.  Very disappointed I need to return both.

In reality, i cannot put a wireless charger in every location i would normally charge my phone, such as in the car, so I planned to continue to also charge the phone sometimes with a wired charger.  The problem is that the case - while it plugs into the lightning port of my phone - then has a usb port for charging.  Thus to use wired charging for my phone - after installing the case - would require me to replace every one of my existing lightning charging cables with usb charging cables.  This is not cost effective and these usb cables would not work with my wife's phone.  If it had a lightning port for wired charging i would have kept the case, but since it does not i plan to return it.\n",

It is not soft like the description says, and it did not work for sensitive, rash-prone skin.<br />I will admit, if it weren't for the scratchy feeling and the almost immediate itchiness, it would be a good strap. The plastic around the spring bars is pretty cheap, but otherwise a good strap for the price.<br />Most people seem to tolerate it fine, but if you have sensitive skin, I would definitely think twice before buying this.\n",

The phone, being glass, is slippery, I definitely have a better grip with this case. Some complain it is too bulky.  Sure, it's not nearly as the phone is, but at east I still have a phone.  I'm on my third iPhone.  This time I got the apple care warranty as well as this case, though I don't know that I'll need the warranty with this case.  One thing to note, this case is not waterproof, so dropping the phone in water will still damage it.  Also, one annoying thing is that I can't connect my phone to my stereo through the headphone jack while the case is on.  It may be the cord I'm using, but I have to take the case off completely to use the jack with the cable I have.  The earbuds and charging port work refectory though.\n",

Meanwhile I have been using the new stylus and it is a wonderful improvement over the rubber tip stylus I used in the past; and with six replacement tips, looks like we'll be partners for a long time.

There is a small metal pin that the clip hinges on, and it came out. I managed to put it back together, and get the spring in place. It is working, but I have to keep an eye on the pin. Honestly, if I just didn't like the case, and the way it holds the phone on the belt clip, I would be inclined to give a totally negative review. I'm just hoping to get as much time out of this case as possible. It's hard to find a case of any quality for the LG stylo 2. This has been the best one that I've tried so far, beccause Otter Box doesn't offer one for this phone. At least, not with a belt clip.\n",

Phone went into the case easily.  However, the back and sides of the case are slippery.  Not as much as the phone itself, but enough that I'm still a bit nervous picking it up.  This is not the fault of the manufacturer.  Just my personal preference that the case I use not be slippery.  The hard plastic shell is the culprit.

When you put your phone on the charging pad a green light goes on to let you know you are charging. (Our phones also make a sound, but I don’t know if that is the case with all phones.). The only issue I have had is if I put both phones on the pad at the same time, I have had one phone not be properly placed, and it didn’t charge. I should have known it wasn’t placed correctly because the phone didn’t make a sound, but I missed it. Overall, I really like this product. Works well, especially for the price.\n",

            "Review: I just got this in and I am impressed. The stylus comes in with two extra tips and a metal cover to go over the tip when it is not in use. The cover screws onto the opposite side of the stylus when you are using it, providing extra hand support. The tip itself has a plastic cover around it which helps support the small tip and provide some protection around it.<br /><br />The FIRST thing you should do is read the directions! I didn't and nearly broke the tip trying to take the plastic protective cover off of it. That plastic protective cover does not come off. As they say, read the directions.<br /><br />I tried it out on my Kindle and it worked perfectly, although there was a time lag between what I drew and when it appeared on the Kindle screen. It allows for finer detail then I have been used to on a touch screen.<br /><br />I was looking for a stylus which could draw fine detail on a touch screen and this seems to be it.<br />My 1st impression is that this is the best fine detail drawing stylus that I have ever used.<br />This is my 1st impression.\n",

            "Review: I just got this in. I am pretty sure that the vender would have sent this to me free to review if I had asked, but I purchased it instead to power my Kindle HD 7. I purchased it because of the power output. It puts out 2.4 amps per USB plug, and it has 2 plugs.<br /><br />First thing that I did was plug my Amazon Kindle into it. My Kindle has been reporting that the adapter which Amazon recommends for the Kindle is not providing enough power, so I ordered this one. And it works! No complaints from my Kindle.<br /><br />You can see from other reviews that it has a nice built-in nightlight. I figure that feature as eye-candy. It's main selling point in my opinion is the 4.8 amp total output producing 2.4 amps per plug. Another nice feature is that 110 v. plug hides away when you have it packed for traveling.\n",

            "Review: Once I got the app and sticker to work correctly, I loved my KnowRoaming sticker/app! The first sticker I ordered from Amazon did not work. So I had to contact customer support, they sent a new one, which I received the day before my trip abroad. I was in a panic, because there were no delivery options besides First Class USPS, all the way across the country from Niagra Falls to California. Installation of the sticker was easy, but getting the app to work was not. I Traveled from San Francisco to Vancouver, BC, had a 24 hour layover, and could not get the app to work. I only had WiFi at my AirB&B, other navigation was impossible, forgot an essential medication that required all my waking time to acquire in a different country. So, I had to wait until I landed in London, accomplished transit travel without navigation again, and settled once again in my AirB&B, to get WiFi, so that I could contact tech support over and over again, to get set up to use. I was so grateful to have navigation again, no time to go further with setup, before I was off to my next destination. Every time one changes county, region, country, one must go back to settings, ask what SIM am I on, reboot the phone, wait for connection, sometimes taking extraordinary amounts of time to do this several times. I could not make phone calls, as I did not want to use the ReachMe services to get political and telemarketing calls and texts while abroad, nor any nonessential calls and texts. WiFi on the trains was virtually impossible without purchasing lengthy times, and most times the data was reading NoService. The last long train trip I made, was an exercise in \"seconds count\", as I had attempted to contact a friend in Slovenia by emails, every means possible, until I was successful in setting up WhatsApp after much travail. We were able to communicate with seconds to spare to meet at the correct location. Once back home, I could not make or receive phone calls or texts for days, then the recommendation was to set my network statistics, which meant I ditched ALL my accounts and passwords saved in this phone. Uh, NO!<br />The support team at KnowRoaming was wonderful, replying quickly to my panic emails.<br />The cost? I have not added up as yet what I spent on data packages, but it was worth the peace of mind knowing that I could access, most of the time.<br />Many trials and tribulations with this sticker, I loved having access when I had it, but I think next time I go abroad, I would purchase the substitute SIM card, replace with my carrier's SIM when I return home, and be relatively assured that I would not have so much hassle with the sticker.\n",

            "Review: I have only had this abut a week, but I was pleased to find I could put my iPhone SE into it without removing it from its Otter Box Defender case.  The belt/sleeve holds the phone snuggly against my bicep, and if I put the phone in upside down, I can easily plug in the earphones or battery while it is riding in the sleeve.  Two things to be aware of; first this is a relatively tight sleeve.  It fits me perfectly but without much room to spare.  I am a medium sized woman without remarkable biceps, and many people (men especially) might find this too tight.  Second, I have found that the touch screen on the phone is not usable through the cover of this holder, on top of the defender cover. This is not a major problem for me as I as using it for working out and just set the phone up just as I want it before it goes in the sleeve, and I can answer phone calls if they come in on the earbud microphone.  So I just plan on not using the touch screen through these layers, but if you wanted to be able to do that you might feel disappointed.  Still, it has worked for me and I even got caught in a heavy rain and the phone stayed safe and dry. I am satisfied and have recommended it to others.\n",

If the phone were to fall flat on its face, no part of the screen would touch the floor. The other cases I can't say the same for. The only thing I miss from my old cases is they had a sliding cover for the cameras. However the back of this case also protects the cameras very well, and I have a screen protector for the cameras themselves.\n",

            "Review: Update 1/6/17: I was unlucky and received a defective unit. Now starts charging in yellow mode and quickly goes to red and then dies. These things use 18650 batteries which are powerful cells but 98% of what is on Amazon are Chinese firecrackers and sold for dirt cheap for a reason. These batteries don't have the proper circuitry protection like PCB and are the reason why pilots don't like them in their cargo... Hoverboards. I might check out a DIY kit that lets you use your own 18650 batteries or replace the battery in this Anker myself with a Nitecore if it's possible.<br /><br />Very disappointed. I had an older version with less power (3200mah I believe) that lasted much longer. I don't know if perhaps mine has a bad battery in it but it won't even fully charge one small phone. The old one could charge devices 3 to 4 times but I gave it to someone.\n",

I have tried other products,  but for my ASUS MEMO 7&#34; tablet, which I use as my GPS,  at best I could only hope for the battery to stay at its current level, or slow the drain. But the SCOSCHE will charge the tablet and my phone while both are under heavy usage.  It's also very small and barely protrudes from the outlet. I just bought a second one for my wife's car.  It's also handy that they are universal in terms of device or brand and that the same cables we use at home will also work in the car.\n",

The only thing that could be better is that the side trim pieces are not all the same width--only slightly off though. I haven had a couple of minor drops and no issues. The wood is much more slippery than the carbon fiber style skin though and something they could work on fixing.<br /><br />One trick with the final part of application with the hair dryer is to put the phone in a large gallon ziplock bag and seal the bag around the nozzle of the hair dryer. Then set it on low for a minute or two and then work in the corners. I found this much more effective as it heats up the entire skin. I have also used this method to bring back this phone from the dead when I dropped it in water--it was only in the water for one second but it wouldn't turn on but the bag trick worked well.\n",

I’ve been working with a Winnie who has been really helpful.<br /><br />The screen works as it is advertised. It does protect the phone. The ability to work the iPhone screen is seem less. My only hope is that in the future they work through a few things to allow us to clean certain kinds of marks from the screen. This is the only reason I didn’t give it five stars.\n",

One or both ends are far too easy to detach.  Not at all useful for my kind of use case.\n",

            "Review: **updated review**<br /><br />After several hours of having the case charge it was finally fully charged. I popped my phone in turned it on and tell me why the case went from fully charged to just having 3 LED lights of charging..... MERP. I plugged the case back in with the phone attached and the case just went crazy with vibrating and not being able to charge the case while charging the phone. Idk if it’s a glitch or what, I mean it charges my phone but the other thing I don’t like is that the lights don’t stay on while using. I definitely have mixed feelings about this case...<br /><br />This review is strictly based off first impressions. I have not used it just yet, it’s in its 5 hour pre use charge still. Which it’s been charging for 3 hours so far and it still only has 3 solid LED lights the rest are still blinking.<br /><br />So first I’d like to start off that I love the feel of it. This is my second external battery case but from another company. I could do without the advertising on the back of the case but whatevs, as long as it does it’s job.<br /><br />I do want to point out that the case is a completely DIFFERENT design than it shows on the front of the box. The case is really thick around the camera area of the phone and I hope it doesn’t cast a shadow on my pics when I use the flash.<br /><br />On the back where the instructions are you can tell it’s talking about a different model because no where on this case does anything close or attach to anything. The whole case is just one piece which is fine with me, that’s how my last case was but the top was flexible to slide the phone in. Which takes me to my next point.. the directions clearlu state DO NOT CREATE AN ANGLE while taking phone in or out of case......... how can I not create an angle my phone just won’t pop in the case, it can’t.. it has the connector in the way.<br /><br />AGAIN this is just off first impressions, I still have high hopes for this but I just wish the case was what I thought I was purchasing.\n",
