The lock & volume buttons work well, the cutouts for the headphone jack, fingerprint sensor, and charging port are all well placed.  The case is flexible, but not overly so, and the leather-like texture makes it easy to hold the phone.  It adds just a little bit of bulk to the phone, but not too much.  The cutout on the back is a little bit smaller than the Nokia logo, but it's not a big deal.  It's a great case for the price.  I'd buy another one.

This little thing provides enough light on a lower setting to give proper lighting for my face. I have to use a higher setting to get proper lighting for my desk. It's a small and compact light that does what it needs to do. The clip is very secure and it doesn't move at all. The battery life is also pretty good. I was able to use it for 4 hours of streaming with a couple of hours of charging. It's a pretty good light for the price. I might get another one just to have a spare.

We broke the glass on one of our phones and went to the kiosk at the mall for a replacement. It was $40, and we were told that we had to buy the &#34;insurance&#34; for another $40. That's $80 for a glass screen protector. We bought this for $6.99 and it's just as good, if not better. It was easy to install and works perfectly! Would definitely recommend!

The buttons on the sides require a LOT of pressing to get them to work, but they do not give much, if any, feedback when pressed. It's hard to tell if you've pressed them enough, and you can't just press them once and be done with it. I'm worried that my phone will get damaged because I have to press the buttons so hard. That's not a good thing.<br /><br />The case is also not very sturdy. It's clear, so you can see the phone through it, which is a plus. But it's also not very thick. It feels flimsy, and I don't think it would protect my phone from much damage. It's good for keeping the phone clean, but that's about it","Given the Product Title, Product Category, Review Rating and Review Title, you are required to generate the Review",Amazon Basics iPhone X Clear Case,Cell Phones & Accessories,2,"Good, Not Great","It fits the phone, which is a plus, considering the reason I got this was that my last case from another brand didn't even fit.<br /><br />That said, there is a definite downside.

This makes both seeing and pushing the side buttons an easier task.  I have a similar case on my phone.  The case is sturdy and well made.  I would definitely recommend this case.  It is a little difficult to get on and off.  But once on, it is secure.  The case does not make the phone bulky.  It is a slim case.  The case does not interfere with the camera.  I am happy with this case.  I would recommend this case.  I purchased this product for a reduced price for an honest and unbiased review.  My opinions are my own.  I would buy again.

I put my phone in my back pocket so the edges have taken on some stains. It's a little slippery to hold on to, but that's just the material. It's easy to put on and take off. It's easy to clean, and I've dropped my phone several times with no damage. I will not be using it for any extreme conditions. I would recommend it for every day use, and if you don't mind the stains. I wouldn't recommend it for kids. I've seen kids drop phones in this case and the screen cracks.

The original headphones that came with the phone were lost, and I needed a replacement. This set was a good replacement. It works just fine with the phone, and I have no complaints. I would recommend this set to anyone who is looking for a replacement set of headphones for their HTC MyTouch 3G phone. It is a good replacement. I would give it 4 stars.<br /><br />I would like to note that the reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it is a bit difficult to put the headphones in your ear. It is not a comfortable fit.","Given the Product Title, Product Category, Review Rating and Review Title, you are required to generate the Review","Original HTC OEM Stereo Handsfree Headset Remote Control for EVO 4G 3D, Desire, HD2 T8585, Incredible S, SENSATION 4G, T-Mobile myTouch 4G - Non-Retail Packaging",Cell Phones & Accessories,4,"Great Job, For Mini Headphones","I bought this particular set of headphones as a replacement for my T-Mobile (HTC) MyTouch 3G phone.

Amazon's price is much lower than Best Buy, where I originally saw it.  The band fits easily onto the watch and is easy to put on and take off.  It is a little thicker than the Apple silicone band, but it is not uncomfortable.  I like the bright color and the pattern.  The only issue I have is that the band does not have any holes to adjust the size.  I have small wrists and the band is a little loose, so I will probably have to wear it with a few links removed.  It is a little tricky to do that, but it can be done.  The band is very cute and funky and is a great addition to my watch collection.

Sadly, I dropped my phone on it's face and completely shattered it just days after putting on this case. After trying a more heavy duty case, I'm back to this one because it just feels so much better to use. So I'm not sure if the phone's face was more susceptible to cracking because of the case or if it was just a fluke. I will update if I ever break it again. Overall, I love this case, just be careful with it! The corners are raised to protect the screen and the back is raised to protect the camera. The case is also easy to put on and take off. I just wish it was a little more protective. If you're looking for a case that feels awesome in your hand and looks sleek, this is the case for you.

Sadly, I dropped my phone on it's face and completely shattered it just days after putting on this case. After trying a more heavy duty case, I'm back to this one because it just feels so much better to use. So I'm not sure if the phone's face was more susceptible to cracking because of the case or if it was just a fluke. I will update if I ever break it again.

I hate feeling like I’m walking around with a rotary phone in my pocket! It has great protection from fairly high falls (I’m clumsy).

It's not the cheapest, but it's a lot cheaper than replacing a phone.  I've dropped my phone on"
